      "content_md": "## Stair Calculation Process\n\n### Step 1: Measure Total Rise\n\n**Critical Measurement**\n- Measure from finish floor to finish floor\n- Include all floor coverings\n- Verify at multiple points if floors not level\n\n**Example:**\n```\nSubfloor to subfloor: 103\"\nFinish floor (upper): 3/4\" hardwood\nFinish floor (lower): 3/4\" hardwood\nTotal rise: 103\" + 0\" = 103\" (3/4\" at each level cancels)\n\nIf different finish floors:\nUpper: 3/4\" hardwood\nLower: 1/4\" vinyl\nTotal rise: 103\" + (3/4\" - 1/4\") = 103-1/2\"\n```\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Number of Risers\n\n**Formula:**\n```\nNumber of risers = Total rise ÷ Target riser height\n\nExample:\nTotal rise: 103\"\nTarget riser: 7\" (within code)\n103\" ÷ 7\" = 14.7 → Round to 15 risers\n```\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Actual Riser Height\n\n**Formula:**\n```\nActual riser = Total rise ÷ Number of risers\n\nExample:\n103\" ÷ 15 = 6.867\" (6-7/8\")\n\nConvert to fraction:\n0.867\" × 8 = 6.93/8 ≈ 7/8\nFinal riser: 6-7/8\"\n```\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Tread Depth\n\n**Using 2R + G = 25\" Rule:**\n```\nG = 25\" - (2 × R)\nG = 25\" - (2 × 6.867\")\nG = 25\" - 13.73\"\nG = 11.27\" (11-1/4\")\n\nVerify: Exceeds 10\" minimum ✓\n```\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Total Run\n\n**Formula:**\n```\nTotal run = Tread depth × (Number of risers - 1)\n\nExample:\nTreads = 15 risers - 1 = 14 treads\nTotal run = 11.25\" × 14 = 157.5\" (13'-1-1/2\")\n```\n\n### Stringer Layout\n\n**Materials:**\n- 2×12 minimum for cut stringers\n- 2×10 with carriages acceptable\n- Select straight, dry lumber\n\n**Layout Procedure:**\n\n```\n1. Mark riser height on framing square leg\n2. Mark tread depth on square blade\n3. Use stair gauges for consistency\n4. Start from bottom of stringer\n5. Mark first rise (subtract 1 tread thickness)\n6. Mark all rises and runs\n7. Mark top connection to header\n8. Verify minimum 3-1/2\" throat\n```\n\n**Bottom Riser Adjustment:**\n```\nFirst riser = Calculated riser - Tread thickness\nExample: 6-7/8\" - 1\" tread = 5-7/8\" first riser\n```\n\n**Top Connection:**\n- May bear on header\n- May hang on header with hanger\n- Verify secure attachment\n\n### Minimum Stringer Throat\n\n```\nThroat = Remaining width after cuts\nMinimum: 3-1/2\" (per NBC)\n\nFor 2×12 (11-1/4\" wide):\nRiser: 7\"\nRun: 10\"\nDiagonal cut: √(7² + 10²) = 12.2\"\nCheck: 11.25\" ÷ (7/12.2) = ~6.5\" throat ✓\n```\n\n### Calculation Verification Checklist\n\n- [ ] Total rise measured finish to finish\n- [ ] Riser height ≤ 200 mm (7-7/8\")\n- [ ] Tread depth ≥ 255 mm (10\")\n- [ ] 2R + G = 635mm ± 25mm\n- [ ] All risers equal (±6 mm max)\n- [ ] Total run fits available space\n- [ ] Headroom maintained (1950 mm min)"

Set stair gauges on square:\n   - Rise on tongue\n   - Run on blade\n\n2. Position square at bottom of stringer:\n   - Align gauges with edge\n   - Mark first riser line\n\n3. Slide square up, maintaining alignment:\n   - Mark each rise and run\n   - Continue to top\n\n4. Mark bottom cut:\n   - Parallel to tread cuts\n   - Height = riser minus tread thickness\n\n5. Mark top cut:\n   - May be plumb (against header)\n   - May be level (on ledger)\n\n6. Cut with circular saw:\n   - Stop short of inside corners\n   - Finish with hand saw\n   - Keep cuts accurate\n```\n\n**Critical: Do Not Overcut**\n- Overcutting weakens stringer\n- Creates visible gaps\n- Use hand saw for clean corners\n\n### Stringer Installation\n\n**Bottom Connection:**\n\n*To concrete:*\n- Pressure-treated kick plate\n- Anchor bolts or concrete screws\n- String secured to kick plate\n\n*To wood floor:*\n- 2×4 or 2×6 cleat nailed to floor\n- Stringer against cleat\n- Through-nail or screw\n\n**Top Connection:**\n\n*Flush with floor:*\n- Upper floor acts as top tread\n- Stringer notched around header\n- Face-nail through header into stringer\n\n*To header face:*\n- Metal stair hanger\n- Or ledger board with joist hangers\n- Most common method\n\n### Reinforcement Options\n\n**Glued Blocks**\n- 2×2 or 2×4 blocks\n- Glued and screwed under treads\n- Reduces squeaks\n- Adds strength\n\n**Metal Brackets**\n- Manufactured stair brackets\n- Quick installation\n- Consistent support\n\n**Kickers**\n- Short studs behind risers\n- Prevents forward movement\n- Required for open risers\n\n### Special Considerations for NB\n\n**Exterior Stairs:**\n- Pressure-treated lumber required\n- Drainage away from house\n- Non-slip surface recommended\n- Consider snow/ice buildup\n\n**Basement Stairs:**\n- May meet concrete floor\n- Moisture protection at base\n- Consider metal stair frame\n\n### Stringer Spacing\n\n| Tread Material | Maximum Span |\n|----------------|-------------|\n| 5/4\" tread | 16\" max |\n| 2×10/2×12 tread | 36\" max |\n| Manufactured tread | Per specs |"

Measure each riser height\n2. Record measurements\n3. Calculate variation\n4. Largest minus smallest ≤ 6 mm\n\n**Run Verification:**\n1. Measure each tread depth\n2. Measure nosing to nosing\n3. Record and compare\n4. Maximum variation ≤ 6 mm\n\n**Handrail Check:**\n1. Verify graspable profile\n2. Measure height at nosings\n3. Check continuity\n4. Verify extensions at ends\n\n**Guardrail Check:**\n1. Measure height from tread/floor\n2. Test baluster spacing (4\" sphere)\n3. Check for climbable elements\n4. Test structural rigidity\n\n### Common Defects\n\n**Dimensional Issues:**\n\n*Uneven Risers*\n- Cause: Calculation error, floor finish not accounted\n- Fix: May require rebuild\n- Prevention: Measure finish to finish, verify before install\n\n*Risers Too High*\n- Cause: Too few risers, incorrect calculation\n- Fix: Add riser (extend stair length) or rebuild\n- Prevention: Calculate with maximum 7-7/8\" target\n\n*Treads Too Shallow*\n- Cause: Space constraints, calculation error\n- Fix: May need to relocate stair\n- Prevention: Verify total run fits before building\n\n**Structural Issues:**\n\n*Springy/Bouncy Treads*\n- Cause: Insufficient stringers, thin treads\n- Fix: Add center stringer, use thicker treads\n- Prevention: Follow stringer spacing requirements\n\n*Squeaky Stairs*\n- Cause: Loose treads, no adhesive\n- Fix: Add screws from behind, shim gaps\n- Prevention: Glue and screw all connections\n\n*Loose Handrails*\n- Cause: Inadequate newel fastening\n- Fix: Add through-bolts, reinforce\n- Prevention: Proper newel installation\n\n### Guardrail Failures\n\n**Spacing Too Wide:**\n- Common at angled sections\n- Test with 4\" sphere at all points\n- Add balusters if needed\n\n**Height Too Low:**\n- Measure from tread nosing, not from back\n- 35\" at stairs, 42\" at landings\n- May need to raise entire rail\n\n**Not Rigid:**\n- Newels must be structural\n- Test with lateral push\n- Reinforce if wobbles\n\n### Documentation\n\n**Record for Each Stair:**\n1.

        ],
        "answer": "To compensate for tread thickness",
        "explanation": "The first riser is reduced by the tread thickness because the tread adds height at all other steps. Without this adjustment, the first step would be taller than all others after treads are installed."
