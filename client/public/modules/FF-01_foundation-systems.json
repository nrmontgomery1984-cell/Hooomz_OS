      "content_md": "## What is a Foundation System?\n\nA foundation is the structural system that transfers all building loads (dead, live, snow, wind) to the supporting soil. It anchors the building, resists movement, and provides a barrier between the structure and ground moisture.\n\n## Foundation Functions:\n\n1. **Load Transfer** - Distributes building weight to soil\n2. **Anchorage** - Resists uplift, sliding, and overturning\n3. **Frost Protection** - Extends below frost depth to prevent heaving\n4. **Moisture Barrier** - Keeps water out of living space\n5. **Level Platform** - Provides flat, stable base for framing\n\n## Why Foundations Matter in NB\n\n### Climate Challenges:\n\n**Frost Depth:**\n- NB Zone 6 (Moncton area): 6 feet (1.8m) frost depth\n- Footings must extend below frost line\n- Frost heaving can destroy inadequate foundations\n- 50-80 freeze-thaw cycles per year\n\n**Moisture:**\n- High water table in many areas\n- 1,100-1,400mm annual precipitation\n- Spring snowmelt flooding common\n- Clay soils hold water\n\n**Soil Conditions:**\n- Varied: Clay, silt, sand, gravel, bedrock\n- Clay expands/contracts with moisture\n- Some areas have marine clay (very unstable)\n- Soil bearing capacity varies greatly\n\n## Foundation Types Overview\n\n### Type 1: Full Basement\n- 8'+ ceiling height below grade\n- Maximum living/storage space\n- Most common in NB residential\n- Highest cost, best value if finished\n\n### Type 2: Crawl Space\n- 3-4' height below floor\n- Access for mechanicals\n- Lower cost than basement\n- Must be properly vented or sealed\n\n### Type 3: Slab-on-Grade\n- Concrete floor at ground level\n- Lowest cost\n- Requires excellent drainage\n- Challenging in NB climate (frost protection critical)\n\n### Type 4: Pier/Post\n- Point supports (decks, additions)\n- Quick, economical for small structures\n- Each pier below frost depth\n\n## Certification Requirements\n\nTo earn Foundation Systems certification:\n1. Complete this guide\n2. Pass quiz with 80%\n3. Assist with one foundation pour\n4. Identify foundation types on 3 existing buildings\n5. Read foundation drawings correctly"

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "NB Zone 6 requires footings to extend 6 feet (1.8m) below grade to get below the frost line and prevent frost heaving."
      },
      {
        "id": "q2",
        "question": "What is the minimum concrete strength for foundation walls?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) 15 MPa", "B) 20 MPa", "C) 25 MPa", "D) 32 MPa"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Foundation walls require a minimum of 25 MPa (3600 psi) concrete. Footings can use 20 MPa minimum."

        "choices": ["A) 4 feet", "B) 6 feet", "C) 8 feet", "D) 10 feet"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Anchor bolts must be spaced at maximum 8 feet (2.4m) on center, with bolts within 12 inches of corners and plate splices."
      },

        "id": "q5",
        "question": "What should you do BEFORE backfilling a foundation?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Just wait 24 hours for concrete to cure", "B) Frame the first floor to provide lateral bracing", "C) Backfill immediately to protect waterproofing", "D) Only wait for waterproofing to dry"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The first floor must be framed before backfilling to provide lateral bracing. Without bracing, the soil pressure during backfill can cause the walls to collapse inward."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Rebar in footings requires minimum 3 inches (75mm) cover from the soil to protect against corrosion and ensure proper concrete encasement."

        "id": "q7",
        "question": "When is a foundation inspection required to be called?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) After backfilling", "B) Before backfilling, after waterproofing", "C) Only if there are problems", "D) After the first floor is framed"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Municipal foundation inspection must be called before backfill, after waterproofing is complete. This allows the inspector to verify wall dimensions, rebar, anchor bolts, and waterproofing."

        "id": "q8",
        "question": "What causes \"honeycombing\" in concrete?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Too much water in mix", "B) Poor vibration or consolidation", "C) Cold weather", "D) Adding too much air entrainment"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Honeycombing (voids in concrete surface) is caused by poor vibration or consolidation. The concrete doesn't fully fill around aggregate, leaving pockets."

        "choices": ["A) 6 inches", "B) 8 inches", "C) 10 inches", "D) 12 inches"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For wall heights of 7 to 8 feet, minimum thickness is 8 inches (200mm). Walls up to 7 feet can be 6 inches; walls over 8 feet require engineering."

        "choices": ["A) Clay", "B) Silt", "C) Bedrock", "D) Fill"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Bedrock has the highest bearing capacity at 12,000+ psf. It provides excellent, stable support. Gravel is second best at 4,000-6,000 psf."

        "choices": ["A) 12 inches", "B) 18 inches", "C) 24 inches", "D) 36 inches"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Maximum step in a stepped footing is 24 inches (600mm). The horizontal run must be at least twice the vertical rise, and rebar must be continuous through the step."

        "question": "What is the purpose of a weeping tile system?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) To water the landscaping", "B) To collect and drain groundwater away from the foundation", "C) To provide ventilation", "D) To support the foundation wall"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Weeping tile (drain tile) collects groundwater around the foundation and drains it away to a sump pit or daylight outlet, preventing hydrostatic pressure against basement walls."
      },
      {
        "id": "q13",
        "question": "What type of crack pattern indicates possible foundation settlement?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Hairline cracks", "B) Diagonal cracks wider at the top", "C) Uniform vertical cracks", "D) Small corner cracks"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Diagonal cracks that are wider at the top (or in stair-step pattern in block walls) indicate differential settlement. This requires engineering review and possible underpinning."
      },
      {
        "id": "q14",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Grade must slope away from the foundation at minimum 5% (6 inches in 10 feet) for a distance of 6 feet. This directs surface water away from the foundation."

        "id": "q15",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Order 5-10% extra concrete beyond calculated quantities to account for spillage, waste, form variations, and over-excavation. Running short during a pour is a serious problem."
