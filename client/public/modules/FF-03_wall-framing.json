      "content_md": "## Wall Framing Fundamentals\n\nWall framing forms the vertical structural skeleton of the building, transferring roof and upper floor loads down to the foundation while defining interior spaces and supporting the building envelope.\n\n### Load Path Continuity\n\nEvery wall frame must maintain a continuous load path from roof to foundation:\n\n- **Roof loads** → Top plates → Studs → Bottom plate → Floor system\n- **Point loads** require direct stud support or engineered headers\n- **Lateral loads** (wind, seismic) transfer through sheathing and connections\n\n### Wall Types in Residential Construction\n\n#### Load-Bearing Walls\n- Support structural loads from above\n- Typically exterior walls and some interior walls\n- Cannot be modified without engineering review\n- Require continuous support to foundation\n\n#### Non-Load-Bearing (Partition) Walls\n- Define interior spaces only\n- Can be parallel to floor joists without direct support\n- Easier to modify during renovations\n- Still require proper framing for stability\n\n### NBC 2020 Requirements for NB Zone 6\n\n**Section 9.23 - Wood-Frame Construction**\n\n| Component | Minimum Requirement |\n|-----------|--------------------|\n| Stud size (exterior) | 2×6 minimum for R-24 insulation |\n| Stud spacing | 16\" o.c. (24\" with engineering) |\n| Top plates | Double 2× required |\n| Bottom plate | Single 2× minimum |\n| Bracing | Let-in bracing or structural sheathing |\n\n### Climate Considerations for NB\n\nNew Brunswick's climate demands specific wall framing approaches:\n\n- **Thermal bridging**: 2×6 walls with cavity insulation + continuous exterior insulation\n- **Wind loads**: Coastal areas require enhanced connections\n- **Snow loads**: Headers sized for accumulated loads\n- **Moisture management**: Proper drainage plane details\n\n### Platform vs. Balloon Framing\n\n**Platform Framing** (Standard in NB):\n- Each floor is built as a platform\n- Walls are framed on deck, then tilted up\n- Fire stops naturally at each floor\n- Most common method for residential\n\n**Balloon Framing** (Historic/Special Applications):\n- Studs run continuously from sill to roof\n- Requires fire blocking at each floor\n- Sometimes used for tall walls or renovations\n- Shrinkage concentrated at sill and top plate"

        ],
        "answer": "1/8\" gap",
        "explanation": "A 1/8\" gap should be left between all sheathing panels to allow for expansion due to moisture and temperature changes. Without this gap, panels can buckle."

        "answer": "Two studs with flat blocking for better insulation",
        "explanation": "A California corner uses two studs with flat blocking between them, providing adequate nailing for interior finish while allowing continuous insulation in the corner cavity, reducing thermal bridging."

        ],
        "answer": "Add a nail within 2\" of the overdriven nail",
        "explanation": "Overdriven nails lose holding power because the head breaks through the panel face. The solution is to add a properly driven nail within 2\" of the overdriven nail, not to remove and replace in the same hole."
