      "content_md": "## What is Material Handling & Storage?\n\nMaterial handling encompasses all activities involved in receiving, moving, staging, and storing construction materials on a jobsite. Proper handling prevents worker injuries, protects materials from damage, and ensures efficient workflow.\n\n## Why Does It Matter?\n\n### Worker Safety:\n- **Back injuries** are the #1 cause of lost workdays in construction\n- Improper lifting causes 25% of all workplace injuries\n- Struck-by injuries from falling materials are common and severe\n- Proper techniques prevent 80% of material handling injuries\n\n### Material Protection:\n- Damaged materials = wasted money and project delays\n- Moisture damage is especially critical in NB's wet climate\n- Improperly stored materials can become safety hazards\n- Some materials (drywall, insulation) are ruined by moisture exposure\n\n### Project Efficiency:\n- Well-organized materials = faster work\n- Proper staging reduces double-handling\n- Good storage prevents searching for materials\n- Efficient delivery coordination prevents delays\n\n## NB Climate Considerations\n\n**Moisture is the Enemy:**\n- Annual precipitation: 1,100-1,400mm (rain and snow)\n- Humidity: 70-85% average\n- Freeze-thaw cycles: 50-80 per year\n- Materials left exposed will be damaged\n\n**Seasonal Challenges:**\n- **Winter:** Snow, ice, frozen ground makes handling difficult\n- **Spring:** Rain, mud, flooding risks\n- **Summer:** Heat affects some adhesives and sealants\n- **Fall:** Rain, early frost, shorter daylight\n\n## Certification Requirements\n\nTo earn Material Handling certification:\n1. Complete this guide\n2. Pass quiz with 80% (12/15)\n3. Demonstrate proper lifting techniques\n4. Organize a material staging area\n5. Properly protect materials from weather"

      "summary": "Covers safe lifting techniques, material weights, storage requirements by material type, and moisture protection strategies.",
      "content_md": "## 2.1 Safe Lifting Techniques\n\n### The NIOSH Lifting Equation Basics:\n\n**Maximum recommended lift:** 51 lbs (23 kg) under ideal conditions\n\n**Ideal Conditions:**\n- Load close to body\n- Lifting from knuckle to shoulder height\n- Good grip, stable footing\n- No twisting required\n- Infrequent lifting\n\n### Proper Lifting Procedure:\n\n1. **Plan the lift:**\n   - Assess weight (if unknown, test by pushing)\n   - Clear path to destination\n   - Get help if over 50 lbs or awkward\n\n2. **Position yourself:**\n   - Feet shoulder-width apart\n   - One foot slightly ahead\n   - Close to load as possible\n\n3. **Grip the load:**\n   - Firm grip with whole hand (not fingertips)\n   - Opposite corners for boxes\n   - Use handles if available\n\n4. **Lift with legs:**\n   - Keep back straight (neutral spine)\n   - Bend at knees and hips\n   - Tighten core muscles\n   - Lift smoothly (no jerking)\n\n5. **Carry safely:**\n   - Keep load close to body\n   - Don't twist - pivot with feet\n   - Watch where you're going\n   - Set down using same technique (reverse)\n\n### Team Lifting:\n\n**When Required:**\n- Loads over 50 lbs\n- Awkward or bulky items\n- Long materials (lumber, drywall sheets)\n- Stairs or uneven surfaces\n\n**Coordination:**\n- One person calls commands\n- Lift on count of three\n- Move together, communicate obstacles\n- Set down together\n\n## 2.2 Common Material Weights\n\n| Material | Unit | Weight |\n|----------|------|--------|\n| 2x4 SPF 8' | Each | 9 lbs |\n| 2x6 SPF 8' | Each | 14 lbs |\n| 2x10 SPF 12' | Each | 32 lbs |\n| Plywood 1/2\" 4x8 | Sheet | 48 lbs |\n| OSB 7/16\" 4x8 | Sheet | 44 lbs |\n| Drywall 1/2\" 4x8 | Sheet | 52 lbs |\n| Drywall 5/8\" 4x8 | Sheet | 70 lbs |\n| Drywall 1/2\" 4x12 | Sheet | 77 lbs |\n| Cement bag | 80 lb bag | 80 lbs |\n| Shingles | Bundle | 65-80 lbs |\n| Batt insulation | Bundle | 15-25 lbs |\n| Rigid foam 2\" 4x8 | Sheet | 8 lbs |\n\n**Key Insight:** Drywall sheets are heavy and awkward - always team lift or use drywall cart.\n\n## 2.3 Storage Requirements by Material\n\n### Lumber:\n\n**Storage Requirements:**\n- Flat, level surface\n- Stickers (spacers) every 4' for air circulation\n- Off ground minimum 4\" (prevents moisture wicking)\n- Covered but ventilated (tarps with air gap)\n- Support prevents sagging/warping\n\n**Maximum Stack Height:** 6' or stable limit\n\n**NB Considerations:**\n- Lumber delivered wet will need to dry before interior use\n- Check moisture content before installing (target <19% framing, <12% trim)\n- Snow load on tarps can collapse stacks\n\n### Plywood/OSB:\n\n**Storage Requirements:**\n- Flat and level (prevents warping)\n- Fully supported (not hanging over edges)\n- Keep dry (OSB swells when wet)\n- Cover top of stack\n\n**Handling:**\n- Carry on edge (two people)\n- Never drag across ground\n- Stack flat, not on edge\n\n### Drywall:\n\n**Storage Requirements:**\n- MUST stay completely dry (ruined by moisture)\n- Store flat OR on edge against wall\n- If flat: fully supported, max 6 sheets per stack\n- If on edge: lean at slight angle against wall\n- Never store in unheated building during freeze\n\n**Critical:** Drywall that gets wet must be discarded - mold risk.\n\n### Insulation:\n\n**Fiberglass Batts:**\n- Keep in packaging until use\n- Store dry and off ground\n- Will expand when removed from package\n- Moisture reduces R-value permanently\n\n**Rigid Foam:**\n- Store flat\n- Keep dry\n- Protect from UV (degrades in sunlight)\n- Don't stack heavy items on top\n\n**Spray Foam:**\n- Store at room temperature (50-85°F)\n- Don't freeze\n- Keep away from heat sources\n- Check expiration dates\n\n### Cement/Concrete Products:\n\n**Bags:**\n- Store on pallets off ground\n- Keep dry (hardens if wet)\n- First in, first out (has shelf life)\n- Stack max 10 bags high\n\n**Ready-mix:**\n- Coordinate delivery with pour schedule\n- Ensure access for truck\n- Have crew ready when truck arrives\n\n## 2.4 Moisture Protection Strategies\n\n### Tarps and Covers:\n\n**Proper Tarping:**\n- Weighted down (won't blow off)\n- Sloped for drainage (no ponding)\n- Air gap underneath (prevents condensation)\n- Secured at edges\n\n**Types:**\n- Blue poly tarps: Temporary, tear easily\n- Silver tarps: Better UV resistance\n- Canvas: Breathable, good for lumber\n- Shrink wrap: Best protection, expensive\n\n### Staging and Timing:\n\n**Just-in-Time Delivery:**\n- Schedule materials to arrive when needed\n- Reduces storage time = less damage risk\n- Better cash flow\n\n**Interior vs. Exterior Staging:**\n- Move moisture-sensitive materials inside ASAP\n- Drywall, trim, flooring: Interior only\n- Framing lumber: Can be exterior with cover\n\n### Ground Protection:\n\n**Keep Materials Off Ground:**\n- Pallets (4\" minimum)\n- Stickers or sleepers\n- Gravel pad for long-term storage\n- Prevents wicking moisture from ground"

        "choices": ["A) Let it dry and use it", "B) Use it in hidden areas only", "C) Discard it - wet drywall must be rejected due to mold risk", "D) Use a dehumidifier to dry it"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Wet drywall must be discarded. It will harbor mold even after drying, the paper facing weakens, and the gypsum core is compromised. Never use water-damaged drywall."

        "question": "When should you use a team lift instead of lifting alone?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Only for items over 100 lbs", "B) Over 50 lbs, awkward shapes, long materials, or unstable conditions", "C) Only when specifically requested", "D) Never - proper technique allows solo lifting of any weight"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Team lift for: loads over 50 lbs, awkward or bulky items, long materials, poor grip available, unstable footing, or when navigating stairs or obstacles."

        "question": "How should tarps be installed to protect materials?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Draped loosely over materials", "B) Weighted down, sloped for drainage, with air gap underneath", "C) Wrapped tightly with no gaps", "D) Just on top, sides can be open"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tarps should be weighted to prevent blowing off, sloped so water drains away (no ponding), and have an air gap underneath to prevent condensation."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When storing drywall flat, stack a maximum of 6 sheets. More sheets create too much weight on the bottom sheets and can cause damage or make handling difficult."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Sheet goods should be carried on edge (vertical) by two people, one at each end. This provides better control and balance than carrying flat."
