The eave drip edge goes under membrane so water entering there drains out. Rake drip edge goes over membrane to direct water onto roof surface."

Cut corner off each shingle at 45°\n6. Seal cut edge with roofing cement\n\n**Open Valley:**\n- Metal valley flashing installed first\n- Shingles cut 3\" from center each side\n- 1/8\" per foot wider toward bottom\n\n### Hip & Ridge Caps\n\n**Pre-formed vs. Cut:**\n- Pre-formed caps: Faster, consistent\n- Cut from 3-tab: Economy option\n\n**Installation:**\n- 5\" exposure standard\n- Nail 1\" from each edge, 5-6\" from exposed end\n- Start at bottom of hips, work up\n- Start at end of ridge opposite prevailing wind"

Install underlayment to curb\n2. Install sill flashing first\n3. Step flashing up sides\n4. Head flashing last, under shingles\n5. Shingle around per manufacturer\n\n> **Best Practice:** Use manufacturer's flashing kit and follow their instructions exactly. Deviations void warranty and invite leaks.\n\n### Common Flashing Failures\n\n| Problem | Cause | Prevention |\n|---------|-------|------------|\n| Lifted step flashing | Nailed through face | Nail in deck only |\n| Chimney leaks | No cricket | Install cricket >30\" |\n| Wall streaking | No kick-out | Always install kick-out |\n| Boot cracking | Sun damage | Use quality materials |"
