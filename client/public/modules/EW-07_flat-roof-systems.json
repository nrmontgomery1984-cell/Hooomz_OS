Fully Adhered (Best for Zone 6)**\n\n| Step | Action | Notes |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| 1 | Clean substrate | Remove dust, debris |\n| 2 | Apply bonding adhesive | To both surfaces |\n| 3 | Allow flash-off | Until tacky |\n| 4 | Roll membrane into adhesive | Work out air bubbles |\n| 5 | Roll with weighted roller | Ensures full contact |\n\n**2. Mechanically Fastened**\n- Plates and screws through membrane\n- Seams lapped and taped\n- Best for re-roofing\n- More vulnerable to wind\n\n**3. Ballasted**\n- Loose-laid membrane\n- Held by stone ballast (10 lbs/sq ft minimum)\n- Requires strong structure\n- Not common in Zone 6 (snow loads)\n\n### Seam Details\n\n**Seam Types:**\n- 6\" minimum overlap\n- Cleaned with EPDM cleaner\n- Primed with seam primer\n- Sealed with 3\" seam tape\n- Rolled firmly\n\n**Critical Points:**\n- Temperature above 40°F for adhesive application\n- No wrinkles in seams\n- Complete primer flash-off before tape\n- Secure corners and edges\n\n### Penetration Flashing\n\n**Pipe Boots:**\n1.

Membrane Shrinkage**\n- **Cause:** Age, UV exposure, improper installation\n- **Fix:** Re-secure edges, patch tears\n- **Prevention:** Proper adhesion, edge details\n\n**3. Seam Failures**\n- **Cause:** Improper installation, movement\n- **Fix:** Clean and re-tape seams\n- **Prevention:** Follow manufacturer procedures\n\n**4. Flashing Failures**\n- **Cause:** Movement, poor adhesion, age\n- **Fix:** Remove and replace flashing\n- **Prevention:** Proper termination details\n\n### Emergency Repairs\n\n**Temporary Leak Mitigation:**\n1. Identify water entry point (often not directly above leak)\n2. Clean and dry area\n3. Apply emergency patch tape or roof cement\n4. Cover with polyethylene if needed\n5. Schedule permanent repair\n\n**When to Call Professional:**\n- Multiple or recurring leaks\n- Membrane beyond repair\n- Structural damage suspected\n- Warranty work\n\n### End-of-Life Indicators\n\n| Sign | What It Means |\n|------|---------------|\n| Widespread cracking | UV degradation, end of life |\n| Multiple patches | System failing |\n| Severe ponding | Structural or slope issues |\n| Blistering throughout | Moisture trapped, adhesion failure |\n| Felt exposure (BUR) | Granule loss, needs replacement |"
