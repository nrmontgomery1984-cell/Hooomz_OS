      "content_md": "## What is Floor Framing?\n\nFloor framing is the structural system of horizontal members (joists, beams, headers) that creates the platform between foundation and living space, or between floors in multi-story construction. It must safely carry all loads while providing a flat, solid base for finishes.\n\n## Floor Framing Components:\n\n1. **Sill Plate** - Connects floor system to foundation\n2. **Rim Joist/Band Board** - Closes perimeter of floor system\n3. **Floor Joists** - Primary spanning members\n4. **Beams/Girders** - Support joists at intermediate spans\n5. **Blocking/Bridging** - Prevents joist rotation and distributes loads\n6. **Subfloor** - Structural sheathing over joists\n\n## Why Floor Framing Matters\n\n### Structural Performance:\n- Carries all live loads (people, furniture: 40 psf minimum)\n- Carries dead loads (structure, finishes: ~15 psf)\n- Must resist deflection (bouncy floors = undersized)\n- Transfers loads to bearing walls/foundation\n\n### Comfort & Quality:\n- Level floors essential for finishes\n- Squeaks from improper fastening/blocking\n- Bounce/vibration from undersized joists\n- Sound transmission between floors\n\n### NB Climate Considerations:\n\n**Moisture:**\n- Basement humidity affects floor from below\n- Crawl space moisture = joist rot risk\n- Vapor barrier location critical\n\n**Thermal:**\n- Floor over unheated space needs insulation\n- Rim joist area = major heat loss point\n- Cold floors over garage/crawl space\n\n## Floor System Types\n\n### Solid Lumber Joists (Traditional):\n- 2×8, 2×10, 2×12 dimensional lumber\n- Simple, familiar to all framers\n- Limited spans, more material needed\n- Shrinkage can cause squeaks, nail pops\n\n### Engineered I-Joists (TJI):\n- OSB web with LVL or solid lumber flanges\n- Longer spans, lighter weight\n- Consistent dimensions (no crowning)\n- Pre-punched knockouts for mechanicals\n- Requires specific hangers and blocking\n\n### Floor Trusses:\n- Open web design\n- Longest spans possible\n- Easy mechanical routing\n- Requires engineered design\n- More expensive, longer lead time\n\n### Engineered Rim Board:\n- LVL or LSL rim instead of dimensional\n- No shrinkage\n- Stronger for deck ledger connections\n- More expensive than lumber rim"

Install subfloor within 10 minutes\n3. Adhesive + fasteners = no squeaks\n4. Don't apply too far ahead (skins over)\n\n### I-Joist Special Requirements:\n\n**Critical for I-Joists:**\n- Never notch or cut holes in flanges\n- Web holes must follow manufacturer specs\n- Bearing on bottom flange only\n- Web stiffeners at point loads and hangers\n- Use only specified blocking panels\n\n## 4.5 Red Flags (Stop and Fix)\n\n- Joist span exceeds tables (add beam)\n- Crown down (flip joist)\n- Missing blocking at bearing\n- Wrong nails in hangers\n- I-joist bearing on web (will crush)\n- Splits in lumber at connections\n- Subfloor not glued (will squeak)\n- Opening headers undersized"

        "choices": ["A) Down", "B) Up", "C) Alternating", "D) It doesn't matter"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The crown (curve) of a joist should always face UP. This creates a slight camber that flattens under load and results in a more level floor."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Anchor bolts must be spaced at maximum 8 feet on center, with additional bolts within 12 inches of ends and plate splices."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Subfloor fasteners must be 6 inches on center at panel edges and 12 inches on center in the field (at intermediate joists)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Common nails", "B) Box nails", "C) Joist hanger nails (short, thick shank)", "D) Finish nails"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Only joist hanger nails (1-1/2\" × 10 gauge) should be used in hangers. Common nails are too long and thin, reducing shear capacity significantly."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Blocking at bearings prevents joists from rotating or rolling over under load, and helps distribute point loads to adjacent joists."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Headers must be doubled when the header span (distance between trimmers) exceeds 4 feet. Hangers are also required when the span exceeds 6 feet."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Minimum joist bearing on wood is 1-1/2 inches. On masonry or concrete, minimum bearing is 3 inches."

        "choices": ["A) Use more nails", "B) Use thicker subfloor", "C) Apply construction adhesive and use ring shank nails or screws", "D) Space joists closer"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Construction adhesive creates a bond between subfloor and joist that prevents the movement causing squeaks. Ring shank nails or screws hold better than smooth shank nails."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Never cut, notch, or drill holes in I-joist flanges. The flanges carry all the bending stress. Holes in the web are allowed per manufacturer's specifications."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Leave 1/8 inch gap between subfloor panels and at walls to allow for expansion. Without this gap, panels can buckle when they absorb moisture."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Web stiffeners are plywood or OSB pieces installed against the web at bearing points, hangers, and point loads. They prevent the thin web from buckling under concentrated loads."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Subfloor end joints must be staggered by at least 4 feet (one full joist bay). This prevents weak lines across the floor and creates a stronger diaphragm."
      },
      {
        "id": "q13",
        "question": "What size subfloor is required for 24\" joist spacing?",

        "choices": ["A) 1/2 inch", "B) 5/8 inch", "C) 3/4 inch minimum (7/8 inch recommended)", "D) 1 inch"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At 24 inch joist spacing, minimum 3/4 inch (or 7/8 inch) subfloor is required. The wider spacing requires thicker panels to prevent deflection between joists."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Sill seal (foam gasket) provides air sealing between the sill plate and concrete, and acts as a capillary break to prevent moisture from wicking into the wood."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When joists are deeper than 2×10 (nominal), blocking or bridging is required at intervals not exceeding 8 feet. This prevents joists from rotating or buckling."
