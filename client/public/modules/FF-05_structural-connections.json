A building is only as strong as its weakest connection.\n\n### Why Connections Matter\n\n1. **Load transfer** - Move forces from one member to another\n2. **Continuity** - Maintain structural integrity through transitions\n3. **Resistance** - Handle gravity, wind, and seismic forces\n4. **Safety** - Prevent progressive collapse\n5. **Code compliance** - Meet NBC 2020 requirements\n\n### Load Path Concept\n\n**Gravity Loads (Downward)**\n```\nRoof → Rafters/Trusses → Top Plates → Studs → \nBottom Plates → Floor System → Foundation → Soil\n```\n\n**Lateral Loads (Wind/Seismic)**\n```\nWind on walls → Sheathing → Framing → \nDiaphragm → Shear walls → Hold-downs → Foundation\n```\n\n**Uplift Loads (Wind)**\n```\nRoof sheathing → Rafters → Hurricane ties → \nWall plates → Anchor bolts → Foundation\n```\n\n### Connection Types\n\n| Type | Function | Example |\n|------|----------|--------|\n| Bearing | Direct gravity load | Beam on post |\n| Shear | Resist sliding | Nails in sheathing |\n| Tension | Resist pulling apart | Hold-downs |\n| Moment | Resist rotation | Rigid frame joint |\n\n### NBC 2020 Connection Requirements\n\n**Section 9.23 - Wood-Frame Construction**\n\n- All connections must provide continuous load path\n- Fastener schedules specify type and quantity\n- Metal connectors where standard nailing insufficient\n- Engineering required for non-prescriptive solutions\n\n### NB Climate Considerations\n\n**Wind Loads**\n- Coastal areas have higher wind speeds\n- Uplift connections critical\n- Hurricane ties mandatory\n\n**Snow Loads**\n- Heavy snow increases gravity loads\n- Connections sized for peak loads\n- Drift areas need enhanced connections\n\n**Temperature Cycling**\n- Freeze-thaw affects fastener pull-out\n- Hot-dip galvanized minimum for exterior\n- Stainless steel in severe exposure\n\n### Connection Categories\n\n**Fasteners**\n- Nails (common, box, ring-shank)\n- Screws (structural, deck)\n- Bolts (anchor, carriage, through)\n- Lag screws\n\n**Connectors**\n- Joist hangers\n- Hurricane/rafter ties\n- Post bases and caps\n- Hold-downs\n- Straps\n- Anchor bolts"

        ],
        "answer": "The connection capacity is significantly reduced",
        "explanation": "Joist hanger capacity ratings are based on specific connector nails. Regular nails may have different shank diameter, length, or strength, significantly reducing the rated capacity of the connection."

        ],
        "answer": "Within 12 inches",
        "explanation": "Anchor bolts must be located within 12 inches of the ends of sill plates to prevent the plate ends from lifting or sliding under lateral loads."

          "To attach the roof"
        ],
        "answer": "To prevent overturning under lateral loads",
        "explanation": "Hold-downs resist the overturning (uplift) forces at the ends of shear walls. When lateral forces try to overturn the wall, the hold-down keeps the end post anchored to the foundation."

        ],
        "answer": "30 degrees",
        "explanation": "Toenails should be driven at approximately 30 degrees to the face of the stud. This angle provides optimal holding power while allowing the nail to properly penetrate both members."

        ],
        "answer": "Flat washer",
        "explanation": "A flat washer must be installed under every anchor bolt nut to distribute the clamping force over a larger area of the sill plate and prevent the nut from pulling into the wood."

        ],
        "answer": "They have higher withdrawal resistance",
        "explanation": "Ring-shank nails have deformed shanks that grip the wood fibers, providing 2-3 times the withdrawal resistance of smooth shank nails. This is critical for sheathing that must resist wind and racking forces."

        ],
        "answer": "Reinstall properly or add support below",
        "explanation": "A joist that doesn't fully seat in the hanger creates a gap that prevents proper load transfer. The connection must be reinstalled correctly or additional support provided to ensure the joist bears fully."
