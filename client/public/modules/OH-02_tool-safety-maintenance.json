      "content_md": "## 2.1 Hand Tool Safety\n\n### General Principles:\n\n1. **Inspect before use** - Check for cracks, chips, loose handles, mushroomed heads\n2. **Use the right tool** - Don't use screwdriver as pry bar, pliers as hammer\n3. **Keep sharp tools sharp** - Dull tools require more force, slip more easily\n4. **Cut away from body** - Direct blade/force away from hands and body\n5. **Secure workpiece** - Use clamps, vise, or helper - don't hold with hand while cutting\n\n### Specific Tool Safety:\n\n**Utility Knife:**\n- Always retract blade when not cutting\n- Cut away from body\n- Replace dull blades immediately (dull = dangerous)\n- Use straight edge for long cuts\n- Never leave blade exposed on bench\n\n**Hammer:**\n- Check handle secure before use\n- Strike squarely (glancing blows = flying hammer)\n- Wear safety glasses (nail heads can shatter)\n- Don't use claw for heavy prying\n- Replace if head is mushroomed or chipped\n\n**Chisel:**\n- Keep sharp (hone regularly)\n- Cut away from body\n- Use mallet, not metal hammer on wood handles\n- Secure workpiece firmly\n- Never carry in pocket with edge exposed\n\n**Hand Saw:**\n- Start cut with pulling stroke (establishes kerf)\n- Let saw do work (don't force)\n- Support cut-off piece (prevents binding)\n- Store with teeth protected\n\n## 2.2 Power Tool Safety\n\n### Universal Power Tool Rules:\n\n1. **Read the manual** - Every tool is different\n2. **Inspect before use** - Cord, housing, guards, blade/bit\n3. **Wear appropriate PPE** - Safety glasses minimum, hearing protection for loud tools\n4. **Secure workpiece** - Clamps, saw horses, helper\n5. **Maintain proper stance** - Balanced, stable, clear of kickback path\n6. **Let tool reach full speed** - Before contacting material\n7. **Don't force** - Let tool do work at appropriate feed rate\n8. **Wait for stop** - Before setting down or adjusting\n9. **Unplug for adjustments** - Blade changes, depth adjustments\n10. **Keep guards in place** - Never remove or disable\n\n### Circular Saw Safety:\n\n**Before Use:**\n- Check blade sharpness (dull blades bind, kick back)\n- Verify guard retracts and returns freely\n- Set depth to 1/4\" below material thickness\n- Check cord for damage\n- Wear safety glasses and hearing protection\n\n**During Use:**\n- Support material on both sides of cut\n- Stand to side of blade (not behind)\n- Allow blade to reach full speed before cutting\n- Don't force - steady, consistent feed\n- Watch for binding (causes kickback)\n- Keep cord behind you\n\n**Kickback Prevention:**\n- Support material properly (prevents pinching blade)\n- Don't cut warped or twisted lumber\n- Don't start cut with blade in contact with material\n- Keep blade sharp\n- Set proper depth\n\n### Miter Saw Safety:\n\n**Setup:**\n- Secure saw to stable surface\n- Verify blade guard operates freely\n- Check blade for damage, missing teeth\n- Ensure fence is square (verify with speed square)\n- Clear work area of debris\n\n**Operation:**\n- Hold workpiece firmly against fence and table\n- Keep hands minimum 6\" from blade path\n- Let blade reach full speed before lowering\n- Lower smoothly (don't slam)\n- Wait for blade to stop before raising\n- Never reach across blade path\n\n### Table Saw Safety:\n\n**Critical Safety Features:**\n- Blade guard with anti-kickback pawls\n- Riving knife (prevents kickback)\n- Push sticks for narrow pieces\n- Featherboards for consistent pressure\n\n**Never Do:**\n- Remove blade guard for through-cuts\n- Stand directly behind blade (kickback zone)\n- Cut freehand (always use fence or miter gauge)\n- Cut warped material\n- Reach over running blade\n\n### Grinder Safety:\n\n**Before Use:**\n- Inspect disc for cracks (ring test)\n- Verify guard is in place\n- Check disc rating matches grinder RPM\n- Wear face shield OVER safety glasses\n- Wear hearing protection\n\n**During Use:**\n- Allow to reach full speed before contact\n- Use proper angle (15-30° for grinding)\n- Don't apply excessive pressure\n- Keep sparks directed away from self and flammables\n- Never remove guard\n\n## 2.3 Cordless Tool Battery Management\n\n### Battery Safety:\n\n**Charging:**\n- Use manufacturer's charger only\n- Don't charge damaged batteries\n- Charge in ventilated area (batteries produce gas)\n- Don't leave on charger indefinitely (most modern chargers auto-stop)\n- Store between 40-80% charge for long-term storage\n\n**Temperature Sensitivity:**\n- Cold reduces capacity (warm battery before heavy use in winter)\n- Heat damages cells (don't leave in hot vehicle)\n- Optimal range: 50-85°F (10-30°C)\n- NB winter: Bring batteries inside overnight\n\n**Storage:**\n- Remove from tool when not in use\n- Store in dry location at room temperature\n- Keep contacts clean\n- Check monthly (charge if below 20%)\n\n### Battery Platform Strategy:\n\n**Henderson Standard: Milwaukee M18**\n- Single platform = battery compatibility\n- Professional grade tools\n- Parts and service available locally\n- Batteries work across all M18 tools\n\n## 2.4 Pneumatic Tool Safety\n\n### Compressor Safety:\n\n- Check oil level (oil-lubricated compressors)\n- Drain moisture from tank daily (prevents rust, inconsistent pressure)\n- Verify pressure relief valve works\n- Don't exceed rated pressure\n- Position intake away from dust/debris\n\n### Nail Gun Safety:\n\n**Critical Rules:**\n1. **Treat like a firearm** - Never point at anyone\n2. **Finger off trigger** - Until ready to fire\n3. **Sequential trigger preferred** - Contact + trigger = fire (safer than bump fire)\n4. **Never disable safety** - Contact element must work\n5. **Disconnect when not in use** - Especially for clearing jams\n6. **Wear safety glasses** - Always\n\n**Nail Gun Injuries:**\n- Penetrating wounds (hands, legs, feet most common)\n- Double-fire injuries (recoil causes second fire)\n- Ricochet injuries (nail deflects off knot, metal)\n\n**Safe Firing Zones:**\n- Never fire at surfaces that may have hidden hazards (wiring, plumbing)\n- Don't fire through material (nail can exit and injure)\n- Be aware of what's behind target\n\n## 2.5 Guards and Safety Features\n\n### Why Guards Exist:\n\n- **Blade guards:** Prevent contact with spinning blade, deflect debris\n- **Riving knife:** Prevents material from closing on blade (kickback)\n- **Anti-kickback pawls:** Grip material if kicked back\n- **Electric brake:** Stops blade quickly when trigger released\n- **Blade guard springs:** Return guard to closed position\n\n### Never Bypass Guards:\n\n**Common Excuses (All Wrong):**\n- \"Guard blocks my view\" - Position differently, use laser guide\n- \"Guard slows me down\" - Injury slows you down more\n- \"Guard doesn't work right\" - Fix it or don't use tool\n- \"Professional doesn't need it\" - Professionals need all 10 fingers\n\n**If Guard Doesn't Work:**\n1. Stop using tool immediately\n2. Tag out (\"Do Not Use - Guard Defective\")\n3. Repair or replace before next use\n4. Never operate without functioning guard"

        "question": "What should you ALWAYS do before changing a blade on any power saw?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Put on gloves", "B) Unplug the saw or remove the battery", "C) Engage the spindle lock", "D) Lower the blade guard"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Always disconnect power (unplug corded tools or remove battery from cordless) before changing blades. This prevents accidental startup which could cause severe injury."
      },
      {
        "id": "q2",
        "question": "When using a circular saw, where should you position yourself?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Directly behind the blade", "B) To the side of the blade, out of the kickback path", "C) In front of the blade", "D) It doesn't matter as long as you hold it firmly"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Always stand to the side of the blade, never behind it. If kickback occurs, the saw will travel backward in line with the blade - standing behind puts you directly in the danger zone."
      },
      {
        "id": "q3",
        "question": "What is the primary cause of circular saw kickback?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Dull blade", "B) Material pinching the blade", "C) Cutting too fast", "D) All of the above can cause kickback"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "All of these can cause kickback. Dull blades bind more easily, material closing on the blade pinches it, and cutting too fast can cause the blade to bind. Proper material support, sharp blades, and appropriate feed rate all help prevent kickback."
      },
      {
        "id": "q4",
        "question": "How should you treat a pneumatic nail gun regarding safety?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Like any other power tool", "B) Like a firearm - never point at anyone", "C) Casually, since they have safety mechanisms", "D) Only carefully when it's loaded"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Nail guns should be treated like firearms - never point at anyone, keep finger off trigger until ready to fire, and always be aware of what's behind your target. Safety mechanisms can fail."
      },
      {
        "id": "q5",
        "question": "What is the proper way to coil an extension cord for storage?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Wrap tightly around your elbow", "B) Coil loosely in large loops", "C) Fold back and forth accordion-style", "D) Just stuff it in a bucket"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Coil cords loosely in large loops. Tight coils stress and damage the internal wires, leading to shorts and potential fire hazards. Loose coils preserve cord life."
      },
      {
        "id": "q6",
        "question": "When should you wear gloves while operating power tools?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Always for protection", "B) Never with rotating tools like saws, drills, or grinders", "C) Only with corded tools", "D) Only in cold weather"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Never wear gloves with rotating power tools. Gloves can catch on spinning blades, bits, or discs and pull your hand into the tool, causing severe injury."

        "id": "q7",
        "question": "How often should moisture be drained from an air compressor tank?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Monthly", "B) Weekly", "C) Daily (after each use)", "D) Only when you notice problems"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Drain the compressor tank daily after use. Moisture accumulates from compressed air and causes rust inside the tank, which can lead to inconsistent pressure and eventual tank failure."

      {
        "id": "q8",
        "question": "What indicates a utility knife blade needs replacement?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) It's been used for one week", "B) It requires more pressure to cut", "C) The handle feels loose", "D) It makes a clicking sound"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A dull blade requires more pressure, which increases the risk of slipping and causing injury. Replace blades immediately when they don't cut easily - dull blades are dangerous blades."

      {
        "id": "q9",
        "question": "What is the ideal storage charge level for lithium-ion batteries during long-term storage?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) 100% (fully charged)", "B) 0% (fully discharged)", "C) 40-80%", "D) It doesn't matter"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Store lithium-ion batteries at 40-80% charge. Storing fully charged or fully discharged can damage cells and reduce battery lifespan. Check and recharge monthly if stored long-term."
      },
      {
        "id": "q10",
        "question": "What should you do if a tool's guard doesn't work properly?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Use the tool carefully without the guard", "B) Remove the guard to prevent it from jamming", "C) Stop using the tool, tag it out, and repair before next use", "D) Continue using it if you're experienced"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Never use a tool with a defective guard. Stop immediately, tag the tool 'Do Not Use - Guard Defective', and repair or replace before using again. Guards are critical safety features."
      },
      {
        "id": "q11",
        "question": "What is the proper depth setting for a circular saw blade when cutting through material?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Blade fully exposed for maximum cutting", "B) About 1/4 inch below the material thickness", "C) Exactly the same as material thickness", "D) 1 inch below material thickness"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Set blade depth to approximately 1/4 inch below the material. This minimizes exposed blade (reducing injury risk), reduces binding, and provides cleaner cuts with less kickback potential."
      },
      {
        "id": "q12",
        "question": "On a circular saw, which direction should the blade teeth point?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Backward (toward the operator)", "B) Forward and upward at the front of the saw", "C) It doesn't matter", "D) Downward at the front"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Circular saw teeth should point forward and upward at the front. The blade cuts on the upstroke at the front, pulling the saw into the material and providing proper chip ejection."
      },
      {
        "id": "q13",
        "question": "How do you verify that a speed square is accurate?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Measure it with a tape measure", "B) Draw a line, flip the square, and see if lines align", "C) Compare it to another speed square", "D) Speed squares are always accurate from the factory"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To verify: place against a factory edge, draw a line, flip the square 180 degrees, and draw another line from the same point. If lines don't align, the square is inaccurate and should be replaced."
      },
      {
        "id": "q14",
        "question": "What type of trigger mechanism is considered safer for nail guns?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Bump fire (contact trigger)", "B) Sequential trigger (contact + trigger required)", "C) Hair trigger for speed", "D) They're all equally safe"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Sequential trigger is safer - requires both contact with the surface AND pulling the trigger to fire. Bump fire (contact trigger) can cause accidental double-fires from recoil or unintended contact."
      },
      {
        "id": "q15",
        "question": "What PPE is required when operating a grinder?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Safety glasses only", "B) Face shield only", "C) Face shield OVER safety glasses, plus hearing protection", "D) Gloves and safety glasses"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Grinders require a face shield worn OVER safety glasses (for debris and disc failure protection) plus hearing protection. Never wear gloves with grinders as they can get caught in the spinning disc."
      },
      {
        "id": "q16",
        "question": "When is professional tool repair recommended over DIY repair?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) For any problem", "B) For electrical issues, motor failure, and gear/bearing replacement", "C) Only for warranty claims", "D) Never - all repairs can be done DIY"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Seek professional repair for electrical issues (sparking, burning smell), motor failure, gear or bearing replacement, and electronic control problems. These require specialized knowledge and tools."
      },
      {
        "id": "q17",
        "question": "In New Brunswick's climate, what special consideration is needed for tool storage?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) No special considerations needed", "B) Store in direct sunlight to prevent mold", "C) Protect from humidity and use desiccants, keep dry", "D) Store outside for ventilation"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "NB's coastal humidity (60-80%) and salt air accelerate rust. Protect tools with sealed storage, desiccant packs, light oil coatings, and ideally climate-controlled storage."

      {
        "id": "q18",
        "question": "What is the purpose of a riving knife on a table saw?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) To guide the wood straight", "B) To prevent material from closing on the blade (prevents kickback)", "C) To hold the wood down", "D) To make the cut smoother"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A riving knife prevents the material from closing on the back of the blade, which is a primary cause of kickback. It's a critical safety feature that should never be removed."
      },
      {
        "id": "q19",
        "question": "How do you test if a grinder disc is safe to use?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) Visual inspection only", "B) Ring test - tap disc and listen for clear ring (not dull thud)", "C) Spin it by hand", "D) Just check the expiration date"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Perform a ring test: suspend the disc and tap it lightly. A good disc produces a clear ring; a cracked disc produces a dull thud. Also visually inspect for cracks and verify RPM rating matches grinder."
      },
      {
        "id": "q20",
        "question": "At what point should you consider replacing a tool rather than repairing it?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) When it's more than 5 years old", "B) When repair cost exceeds 50% of replacement cost", "C) When any part breaks", "D) Never - always repair"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If repair cost exceeds 50% of replacement cost, it's generally more economical to replace. New tools come with warranties and current safety features, making replacement the better value."
