Skipping prep leads to peeling, poor adhesion, and visible defects.\n\n### New Drywall Preparation\n\n1. **Dust removal** - Vacuum or wipe all surfaces\n2. **Spot prime** - PVA primer on mud and repairs\n3. **Full prime** - Entire surface with drywall primer\n4. **Light sand** - 220-grit after primer dries\n5. **Tack wipe** - Remove sanding dust\n\n### Previously Painted Surfaces\n\n**Assessment Checklist:**\n- Check adhesion (cross-hatch tape test)\n- Identify glossy areas requiring scuff-sand\n- Locate repairs needing spot prime\n- Note stains requiring stain-blocking primer\n\n### Primer Selection\n\n| Surface Condition | Primer Type |\n|-------------------|-------------|\n| New drywall | PVA drywall primer |\n| Stains (water, smoke) | Shellac-based or pigmented shellac |\n| Glossy surfaces | Bonding primer |\n| Bare wood | Wood primer (latex or oil) |\n| Tannin-bleeding wood | Shellac primer |\n\n### Masking & Protection\n\n- **Painter's tape:** Use quality tape (14-day removal)\n- **Drop cloths:** Canvas preferred over plastic\n- **Edge protection:** Tape ceiling lines, trim edges\n- **Hardware:** Remove switch plates, outlet covers\n- **Fixtures:** Mask or remove light fixtures"

      "title": "Cutting In Techniques",
      "content": "## Professional Cutting In\n\nCutting in creates clean edges at corners, ceilings, and trim before rolling. This technique separates amateur from professional results.\n\n### Brush Selection\n\n| Brush Type | Best For | Size |\n|------------|----------|------|\n| Angled sash | Cutting in, trim | 2-2.5\" |\n| Straight edge | Flat surfaces | 3-4\" |\n| Oval sash | Windows, detail | 1.5-2\" |\n\n**Quality brush indicators:**\n- Flagged bristle tips (hold more paint)\n- Tapered shape (fine edge control)\n- Solid ferrule (no loose bristles)\n\n### Cutting In Process\n\n1. **Load brush** - Dip 1/3 into paint, tap excess\n2. **Position** - Start 1/4\" from edge\n3. **Pressure stroke** - Press bristles, draw toward edge\n4. **Feather** - Light pressure on return stroke\n5. **Overlap** - Work in 3-4 foot sections\n\n### Edge Techniques\n\n**Ceiling Lines:**\n- Work toward the corner\n- Use ceiling as guide surface\n- Maintain wet edge for blending\n\n**Corner Lines:**\n- Cut one wall, let dry\n- Cut adjacent wall into corner\n- Overlap slightly for coverage\n\n**Trim Edges:**\n- Cut wall paint to trim edge\n- Clean, steady strokes\n- Touch up after trim paint cures\n\n> **Pro Tip:** Cut in before rolling and maintain a wet edge. Work in 4-6 foot sections to blend cut lines into rolled areas."

      "title": "Rolling Techniques",
      "content": "## Professional Rolling Methods\n\nProper rolling technique ensures even coverage, eliminates lap marks, and creates a uniform finish.\n\n### Roller Selection\n\n| Nap Length | Surface Type | Texture Result |\n|------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 3/16\" - 1/4\" | Smooth surfaces, doors | Very smooth |\n| 3/8\" | Light texture, drywall | Light stipple |\n| 1/2\" | Medium texture | Medium stipple |\n| 3/4\" - 1\" | Heavy texture, stucco | Heavy texture |\n\n**Roller quality factors:**\n- Shed-resistant fabric\n- Beveled edges (reduce lines)\n- Sturdy core (won't collapse)\n\n### Rolling Pattern (W-Method)\n\n1. **Load roller** - Roll in tray, remove excess\n2. **Apply W pattern** - Cover 3' x 3' area\n3. **Fill in** - Cross-roll to fill W\n4. **Finish strokes** - Light vertical passes\n5. **Feather edges** - Blend into adjacent areas\n\n### Avoiding Common Defects\n\n| Defect | Cause | Prevention |\n|--------|-------|------------|\n| Lap marks | Dried edges | Maintain wet edge |\n| Roller lines | Too much pressure | Light final passes |\n| Stipple variation | Inconsistent loading | Uniform roller saturation |\n| Holidays (misses) | Poor lighting | Use side lighting to check |\n| Drips | Overloaded roller | Remove excess in tray |\n\n### Coverage Rates\n\n- **Primer:** 300-400 sq ft/gallon\n- **First coat:** 350-400 sq ft/gallon\n- **Second coat:** 400-450 sq ft/gallon\n\n> **Pro Tip:** For ceilings, roll perpendicular to the main light source. For walls, finish with vertical strokes for consistent sheen."

Quality trim work elevates the entire room's appearance.\n\n### Trim Preparation\n\n1. **Clean** - TSP wash, rinse thoroughly\n2. **Sand** - 150-220 grit, scuff glossy surfaces\n3. **Caulk** - Fill gaps at wall/trim junction\n4. **Prime** - Spot prime bare wood, repairs\n5. **Sand primer** - 220-grit, tack wipe\n\n### Painting Sequence\n\n**Standard Order:**\n1. Ceiling\n2. Walls\n3. Trim (after walls cure 24+ hours)\n4. Doors\n5. Final touch-ups\n\n**Trim-First Method (New Construction):**\n1. Prime all surfaces\n2. Paint trim\n3. Tape trim edges\n4. Paint walls\n5. Remove tape, touch up\n\n### Brush Technique for Trim\n\n| Surface | Direction | Method |\n|---------|-----------|--------|\n| Baseboards | Horizontal | Long, even strokes |\n| Door casings | Follow grain | Vertical strokes |\n| Window sills | Horizontal | Thin coats, sand between |\n| Crown moulding | Follow profile | Work in sections |\n\n### Door Painting (Panel Doors)\n\n**Sequence:**\n1. Panels (recessed areas first)\n2. Panel moulding/edges\n3. Horizontal rails\n4. Vertical stiles\n5. Edges (hinge side, latch side)\n\n### Drying & Recoating\n\n| Paint Type | Touch Dry | Recoat | Full Cure |\n|------------|-----------|--------|----------|\n| Latex | 1 hour | 2-4 hours | 30 days |\n| Alkyd | 6-8 hours | 16-24 hours | 7 days |\n| Waterborne alkyd | 1 hour | 4-6 hours | 7 days |\n\n> **Pro Tip:** For the smoothest trim finish, thin latex paint 5-10% with water, apply thin coats, and sand lightly with 320-grit between coats."
