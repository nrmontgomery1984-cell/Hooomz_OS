          "Standard IC-rated fixtures",
          "Non-IC-rated fixtures with enclosure",
          "IC-rated Air-Tight (ICAT) fixtures",
          "Any fixture if covered with drywall"
        ],
        "answer": "IC-rated Air-Tight (ICAT) fixtures",
        "explanation": "Only ICAT (Insulation Contact Air Tight) fixtures are both safe for insulation contact AND sealed against air leakage. Standard IC-rated fixtures may not be air-sealed."

        ],
        "answer": "Attic hatches",
        "explanation": "Attic hatches are often the worst single source of air leakage because they connect directly to the attic, have large perimeters, and are frequently unsealed and uninsulated."

        ],
        "answer": "Acoustical sealant or vapor barrier boxes",
        "explanation": "Electrical boxes should be sealed with acoustical sealant (flexible) or purpose-built vapor barrier boxes that have sealed flanges. Standard caulk can crack, and tape doesn't provide adequate seal."

          "They are the same thing",
          "Air barrier stops air flow; vapor barrier slows moisture diffusion",

        ],
        "answer": "Air barrier stops air flow; vapor barrier slows moisture diffusion",
        "explanation": "An air barrier stops bulk air movement (convection), while a vapor barrier slows moisture diffusion through materials. In NB, 6 mil poly serves both functions when properly installed."

        "answer": "Sill gasket",
        "explanation": "A sill gasket should be installed between the foundation and sill plate. It provides an air seal at this critical junction and also acts as a capillary break against moisture."

          "No problem - it works the same",
          "Moisture can condense inside the wall cavity",

          "The wall will be too air-tight"
        ],
        "answer": "Moisture can condense inside the wall cavity",
        "explanation": "In NB's cold climate, an exterior vapor barrier traps moisture that diffuses outward from the interior. This moisture condenses on the cold vapor barrier, leading to rot, mold, and insulation damage."

        "answer": "Smoke pencil",
        "explanation": "A smoke pencil (or theatrical fog) produces visible smoke that shows air movement during a blower door test. The smoke is drawn toward leaks, identifying their exact location."
