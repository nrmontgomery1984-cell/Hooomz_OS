It includes daily cleanup routines, material recycling, hazardous waste handling, and final project cleanup.\n\n## Why Does It Matter?\n\n### Environmental Responsibility:\n- Construction generates 30-40% of landfill waste in Canada\n- Many materials can be recycled or reused\n- Improper disposal contaminates soil and water\n- NB Clean Environment Act requires proper disposal\n\n### Client Relations:\n- Clean site = professional impression\n- Daily cleanup shows respect for client's property\n- Dust and debris control protects client belongings\n- Final cleanup determines lasting impression\n\n### Safety:\n- Debris causes trips, falls, puncture wounds\n- Fire hazards from combustible waste\n- Respiratory hazards from dust accumulation\n- Falling hazards from improperly stored waste\n\n### Cost Control:\n- Proper sorting reduces disposal costs\n- Recycling can generate revenue\n- Efficient cleanup saves labor time\n- Avoiding fines for improper disposal\n\n## NB Regulatory Requirements\n\n### Clean Environment Act:\n- Prohibits illegal dumping\n- Requires proper disposal of designated materials\n- Fines up to $50,000 for violations\n- Directors/officers personally liable\n\n### Designated Materials (Special Handling Required):\n- Asbestos-containing materials\n- Lead paint waste\n- Electronics (e-waste)\n- Fluorescent bulbs\n- Batteries\n- Paint and solvents\n- Refrigerants (appliances)\n\n## Certification Requirements\n\nTo earn Waste Management certification:\n1. Complete this guide\n2. Pass quiz with 80% (12/15)\n3. Demonstrate proper waste sorting\n4. Complete a daily cleanup to standard\n5. Know locations of local disposal facilities"

      "summary": "Daily cleanup routines, waste sorting procedures, bin management, and final cleanup process.",
      "content_md": "## 3.1 Daily Cleanup Routine\n\n### During Work (Continuous):\n\n**Every Worker's Responsibility:**\n1. Pick up scraps as you generate them\n2. Stack reusable cutoffs (don't throw away good material)\n3. Keep tools organized (not scattered)\n4. Sweep work area periodically\n5. Don't let debris accumulate\n\n**The 15-Minute Rule:** Never let more than 15 minutes of cleanup accumulate.\n\n### Mid-Day Cleanup (Lunch Break - 10 minutes):\n\n1. Quick sweep of main work area\n2. Organize tools and materials\n3. Remove full trash bags\n4. Stack lumber/material cutoffs\n5. Clear walkways\n\n### End of Day Cleanup (30-45 minutes):\n\n**Step 1: Collect All Debris (15 min)**\n- Gather all scraps from work area\n- Check adjacent rooms (dust travels)\n- Collect packaging, cutoffs, trash\n- Sort into appropriate piles\n\n**Step 2: Sort Materials (10 min)**\n- Metal to metal pile\n- Cardboard flattened and stacked\n- Clean wood to wood pile\n- Mixed debris to waste bin\n- Hazardous materials set aside\n\n**Step 3: Transport to Bins (10 min)**\n- Load debris into wheelbarrow/cart\n- Transport to appropriate bin/pile\n- Don't overfill bins (lid must close)\n- Flatten boxes to save space\n\n**Step 4: Final Sweep (5-10 min)**\n- HEPA vacuum work area (dust control)\n- Sweep non-work areas (if dust spread)\n- Wipe surfaces if dusty\n- Check client areas (kitchen, bath if accessible)\n\n**Step 5: Verify (5 min)**\n- Walk through all areas\n- Remove any remaining hazards\n- Ensure client can use their home safely\n- Lock up bins if required\n\n## 3.2 Waste Sorting Procedure\n\n### At Point of Generation:\n\n**Train Yourself to Sort Immediately:**\n- Metal cutoff? → Metal pile\n- Cardboard box? → Flatten, stack\n- Wood cutoff reusable? → Cutoff pile\n- Wood scrap too small? → Wood bin\n- Mixed debris? → General waste\n\n### Setting Up Sort Station:\n\n**Basic Setup (3 containers):**\n1. **Garbage bags/cans** - Mixed waste\n2. **Metal bin/tarp** - All metals\n3. **Cardboard area** - Flattened boxes\n\n**Enhanced Setup (5+ areas):**\n1. Mixed waste bin\n2. Metal collection\n3. Cardboard\n4. Clean wood\n5. Reusable materials\n6. Hazardous materials (separate, labeled)\n\n### Handling Specific Materials:\n\n**Drywall:**\n- Keep clean drywall separate if recycling available\n- No painted, wet, or contaminated drywall\n- Stack neatly (easier to handle)\n\n**Insulation:**\n- Bag fiberglass (prevents spreading)\n- Keep dry for recycling potential\n- Wear respirator when handling\n\n**Concrete/Masonry:**\n- Separate from other debris\n- Can be crushed and recycled\n- Heavy - don't overload bins\n\n## 3.3 Bin Management\n\n### Loading the Bin:\n\n**Do:**\n- Load heavy items first (bottom)\n- Distribute weight evenly\n- Flatten boxes to maximize space\n- Break down large items when safe\n- Fill to level with top (not heaping)\n\n**Don't:**\n- Overload beyond top edge\n- Put prohibited items in bin\n- Mix hazardous with regular waste\n- Create unstable piles\n- Block bin doors with debris\n\n### Prohibited Items (Most Bins):\n- Hazardous waste (paint, solvents)\n- Asbestos\n- Tires\n- Appliances with refrigerants\n- Electronics\n- Batteries\n- Fluorescent bulbs\n- Liquids\n\n### Scheduling Bin Service:\n\n**When to Call for Pickup:**\n- Bin is 80% full\n- Before weekends/holidays (limited service)\n- Weather event approaching (cover or empty)\n- Material type change (don't mix loads)\n\n**Swap vs. Empty:**\n- Swap: Exchange full bin for empty\n- Empty: Truck tips bin, returns it\n- Swap faster, empty more cost-effective\n\n## 3.4 Final Project Cleanup\n\n### Level 1: Rough Clean (End of Construction)\n\n**Scope:** Remove all construction debris and materials\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Remove all scraps, debris, packaging\n2. Remove all leftover materials\n3. Remove all protection (floor, plastic)\n4. Sweep all floors\n5. Remove bins and waste piles\n\n**Result:** Bare, clean surfaces ready for finishing\n\n### Level 2: Construction Clean (Pre-Occupancy)\n\n**Scope:** Remove dust and debris from all surfaces\n\n**Steps:**\n1. All Level 1 steps plus:\n2. Vacuum all floors (HEPA)\n3. Wipe all horizontal surfaces\n4. Clean windows (interior)\n5. Wipe cabinets (inside and out)\n6. Clean fixtures (lights, outlets, switches)\n7. Vacuum/clean HVAC registers\n\n**Result:** Presentable, but not spotless\n\n### Level 3: Final Clean (Client Move-In Ready)\n\n**Scope:** Professional cleaning standard\n\n**Steps:**\n1. All Level 2 steps plus:\n2. Mop all hard floors\n3. Clean all glass (windows, mirrors, shower)\n4. Detail clean all fixtures\n5. Clean appliances (inside and out)\n6. Dust all surfaces including tops\n7. Clean light fixtures\n8. Touch-up any scuffs or marks\n9. Final walk-through inspection\n\n**Result:** Move-in ready, client satisfied\n\n### Final Cleanup Checklist:\n\n- [ ] All debris removed\n- [ ] All materials removed or stored per client\n- [ ] Floors swept and vacuumed\n- [ ] Surfaces wiped\n- [ ] Windows cleaned\n- [ ] Fixtures cleaned\n- [ ] Cabinets cleaned inside\n- [ ] Appliances cleaned\n- [ ] Lights/switches/outlets wiped\n- [ ] Final walk-through complete\n- [ ] Client sign-off obtained"
