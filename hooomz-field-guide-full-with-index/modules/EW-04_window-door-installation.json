Measure width at top, middle, and bottom\n2. Measure height at left, center, and right\n3. Check diagonals for square (≤1/8\" difference)\n4. Use smallest dimension for ordering\n\n### Sill Pan Installation\n\n**Critical for Water Management:**\n\n1. **Back Dam:** Minimum 1\" tall at interior\n2. **End Dams:** Seal at jambs to prevent lateral water flow\n3. **Slope:** 5-15° toward exterior for drainage\n4. **Materials:** Peel-and-stick membrane or formed metal\n\n**Installation Steps:**\n\n| Step | Action | Why It Matters |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| 1 | Cut sill membrane 12\" wider than opening | Allows proper jamb laps |\n| 2 | Create back dam with folded membrane | Prevents interior water entry |\n| 3 | Install sill piece first | Water sheds over this layer |\n| 4 | Lap jamb pieces over sill | Water on jambs drains to sill |\n| 5 | Head flashing goes last, under WRB | Shingle principle protection |\n\n### Pre-Installation Checklist\n\n- [ ] Rough opening is plumb and square\n- [ ] Structural header properly sized\n- [ ] King studs and jack studs secure\n- [ ] Sill plate level within 1/8\"\n- [ ] No protruding fasteners or debris\n- [ ] WRB properly installed to opening\n- [ ] Sill pan complete with dams"

Dry Fit the Window**\n- Set window in opening without fasteners\n- Check operation of all sashes\n- Verify adequate shim space all around\n- Remove and make adjustments if needed\n\n**2. Apply Sealant Bed**\n- Continuous bead on sill pan\n- Sealant on back of nailing flange (flanged windows)\n- Creates primary water seal\n\n**3. Set Window in Opening**\n- Tip window into opening\n- Center in rough opening\n- Press firmly into sealant bed\n\n**4. Shim and Level**\n\n| Location | Shim Points | Check |\n|----------|-------------|-------|\n| Sill | Every 12\" and at jamb shims | Level |\n| Jambs | 2\" from corners, then every 12\" | Plumb |\n| Head | Only if needed for square | Level |\n\n**5. Fasten Window**\n- Nail through flange at corners first\n- Verify operation before completing\n- Fasten every 6-8\" around perimeter\n- Don't over-drive nails (distorts frame)\n\n**6. Insulate and Seal**\n\n> **CRITICAL:** Use only low-expansion foam labeled for windows and doors. Standard foam can bow frames and void warranties.\n\n**Foam Application:**\n- Fill 50-70% of cavity (foam expands)\n- Apply in lifts if deep cavity\n- Allow full cure before trimming\n\n### Flanged vs. Flangeless Windows\n\n| Type | Sealing Method | Common Use |\n|------|----------------|------------|\n| **Flanged** | Flange tape over nailing fin | New construction |\n| **Flangeless** | Interior sealed, exterior trim | Replacement, masonry |"

Prepare Opening**\n- Level subfloor/sill area\n- Install sill pan flashing\n- Dry-fit door unit\n\n**2. Set Door Unit**\n- Apply sealant to back of brickmould\n- Tip unit into opening\n- Center in rough opening\n\n**3. Shim and Secure**\n\n| Priority | Location | Method |\n|----------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Hinge side | Shim behind each hinge |\n| 2 | Lock side top | Shim and check operation |\n| 3 | Lock side bottom | Shim for consistent reveal |\n| 4 | Threshold | Shim level, no bounce |\n\n**4. Fasten Properly**\n- Drive screws through hinges into framing (3\" screws)\n- Secure jamb at shim points only\n- Anchor threshold to subfloor\n\n**5. Threshold Sealing**\n- Caulk under threshold (back dam)\n- Verify weatherstrip contact all around\n- Check door swing for proper latching\n\n### Common Door Problems\n\n| Issue | Cause | Solution |\n|-------|-------|----------|\n| Door swings open/closed | Jamb not plumb | Adjust hinge-side shims |\n| Sticks at top | Jamb twisted | Adjust shims, check level |\n| Air gaps | Poor weatherstrip contact | Adjust strike, replace weatherstrip |\n| Water entry | Threshold not sealed | Re-caulk, check sill pan |"

      "content_md": "## Flashing & Weatherproofing\n\n### The Shingle Principle\n\n**Golden Rule:** Water flows downhill. Every layer must overlap the one below.\n\n**Proper Sequence (Bottom to Top):**\n1. Sill pan/membrane installed\n2. Window/door set and fastened\n3. Jamb flashing tape applied\n4. Head flashing tape applied\n5. WRB lapped over head flashing\n6. Exterior trim installed with sealant\n\n### Flashing Tape Application\n\n**Material Selection:**\n| Type | Temperature Range | Adhesion | Use |\n|------|-------------------|----------|-----|\n| **Butyl-based** | Wide (-40°F to 200°F) | Excellent | All-purpose, preferred for Zone 6 |\n| **Asphalt-based** | Limited (40°F+) | Good | Warm weather only |\n| **Acrylic** | Moderate | Good | Secondary flashing |\n\n**Application Requirements:**\n- Surface must be clean, dry, primed if needed\n- Apply above 25°F for most products\n- Minimum 3\" overlap at all seams\n- Roll firmly with J-roller for full adhesion\n- No wrinkles or fish-mouths\n\n### Head Flashing Detail\n\n**Critical for Water Management:**\n\n1. Flashing tape extends minimum 6\" past jambs\n2. Top edge tucked under WRB\n3. Mechanically fasten metal drip cap if required\n4. Sealant behind any horizontal trim\n\n### Integration with Cladding\n\n**Vinyl/Aluminum Siding:**\n- J-channel or window trim creates drainage plane\n- Maintain 1/4\" gap from window frame\n- Caulk only at head, not jambs/sill (allow drainage)\n\n**Wood/Fiber Cement:**\n- Back-caulk all trim pieces\n- Leave 1/4\" gap at sill, caulk at head\n- Prime all cut edges before installation\n\n**Stucco/EIFS:**\n- Casing bead at window perimeter\n- Sealant joint between bead and frame\n- Control joint placement critical\n\n### Common Failures\n\n> **Field Observation:** 90% of window leaks occur at sill corners. Take extra care with corner flashing details.\n\n| Failure | Cause | Prevention |\n|---------|-------|------------|\n| Sill corner leaks | Inadequate corner wrap | Fully wrap membrane at corners |\n| Head leaks | WRB not lapped over flashing | Follow shingle principle |\n| Jamb streaking | Caulk failure | Use quality sealant, back-caulk trim |\n| Condensation | Poor thermal break | Specify thermally broken frames |"
