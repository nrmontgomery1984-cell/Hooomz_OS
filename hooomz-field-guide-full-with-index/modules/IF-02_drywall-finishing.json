Level 5 is recommended for areas with gloss paint or angled/natural lighting.\n\n### Joint Compound Types\n\n**Setting-Type (Hot Mud):**\n- Sets by chemical reaction\n- Available in 5, 20, 45, 90 minute sets\n- Harder, more shrink-resistant\n- Good for: First coat, filling gaps, repairs\n\n**Drying-Type (Pre-Mixed):**\n- Dries by evaporation\n- Easier to sand\n- Three formulations:\n\n| Type | Use | Characteristics |\n|------|-----|----------------|\n| **Taping** | Embedding tape | Strong adhesion, harder |\n| **Topping** | Final coats | Easy sanding, smooth finish |\n| **All-Purpose** | Any coat | Compromise of both |\n\n### Tape Selection\n\n| Type | Pros | Cons | Best For |\n|------|------|------|----------|\n| **Paper Tape** | Strongest, thin | Requires embedding | Flat joints, inside corners |\n| **Mesh Tape** | Self-adhesive, easy | Weaker, needs hot mud | Quick repairs |\n| **Metal Corner Bead** | Straight corners | Visible if damaged | Outside corners |\n| **Paper-Faced Bead** | Blends better | Slightly weaker | Outside corners |\n| **Flex Bead** | Curves possible | More expensive | Arches, curved corners |"

      "content_md": "## Taping Techniques\n\n### Tools Required\n\n- 4-6\" taping knife\n- 10-12\" finishing knife\n- Corner knife or trowel\n- Mud pan\n- Banjo or tape dispenser (optional)\n- Sanding pole and screens/paper\n- Hawk (for larger jobs)\n\n### Flat Joint Taping (Factory Edges)\n\n**Step 1: Apply Bed Coat**\n- Load knife with compound\n- Apply 4-6\" wide band centered on joint\n- Consistent thickness, no gaps\n- Slightly overfill\n\n**Step 2: Embed Tape**\n1. Center tape over joint\n2. Press lightly into compound\n3. Start at one end, work to other\n4. Pull knife at 45° angle\n5. Squeeze out excess compound (leave thin layer)\n6. No bubbles, wrinkles, or dry spots\n\n**Step 3: Cover Coat**\n- Immediately apply thin coat over tape\n- Feather edges outward\n- Fill recessed area created by tapered edges\n\n### Butt Joint Taping\n\n**The Challenge:** No recess at butt joints - must create flat finish over raised joint.\n\n**Technique:**\n1. Apply compound, embed tape as above\n2. Feather WIDE - 12-16\" minimum each side\n3. Build up very thin layers\n4. Sand carefully to blend\n\n> **Pro Tip:** Use a \"skim coating\" technique - apply very thin layers over wide area to hide the hump.\n\n### Inside Corner Taping\n\n**Method 1: Paper Tape**\n1. Fold tape along crease\n2. Apply compound to both sides\n3. Press tape into corner\n4. Run corner knife to embed\n5. Finish one side at a time (let dry between)\n\n**Method 2: Corner Bead**\n- Paper-faced corner bead\n- Embed with compound\n- Easier to get straight corner\n\n### Common Taping Mistakes\n\n| Mistake | Problem | Fix |\n|---------|---------|-----|\n| Dry tape edges | Will peel | Re-embed with compound |\n| Too much compound | Hard to sand, shows through | Scrape off, re-apply thin |\n| Bubbles under tape | Tape failure | Cut out, re-tape |\n| Wrinkled tape | Visible through paint | Remove, re-tape |"

      "content_md": "## Coating & Feathering\n\n### Second Coat (Block Coat)\n\n**Purpose:** Fill tape edges, begin feathering\n\n**Procedure:**\n1. Wait for first coat to dry completely (24 hours typical)\n2. Knock down any ridges with knife (don't sand yet)\n3. Apply compound wider than first coat\n4. Feather edges to nothing\n5. Cover all visible tape edges\n\n**Width Progression:**\n- First coat: 4-6\" wide\n- Second coat: 8-10\" wide\n- Third coat: 12-14\" wide\n\n### Third Coat (Finish Coat)\n\n**Purpose:** Final smoothing, complete feathering\n\n**Procedure:**\n1. Wait for second coat to dry\n2. Light sand or knock down ridges\n3. Apply thin coat, feather to 12-14\" wide\n4. Focus on smoothness and blend\n5. Use topping compound for easiest sanding\n\n### Feathering Technique\n\n**The Key to Invisible Joints:**\n\n1. Hold knife at low angle (15-20°)\n2. Gradually lift handle as you pull\n3. Edge should taper to nothing\n4. No compound \"ridges\" at edges\n5. Wipe knife frequently\n\n**Checking Your Work:**\n- Side-light the wall (flashlight at angle)\n- Look for shadows from ridges\n- Imperfections visible now will show worse with paint\n\n### Screw Spots\n\n**Three-Coat Minimum:**\n1. First coat: Fill dimple flush\n2. Second coat: Slight overfill, feather\n3. Third coat: Final blend\n\n**Application:**\n- Wipe in one direction\n- Then perpendicular\n- Creates X pattern coverage\n\n### Inside Corners\n\n**Alternating Technique:**\n- First coat: Both sides\n- Second coat: One side only\n- Third coat: Other side only\n- Prevents building up corner\n\n### Drying Time Guide\n\n| Conditions | Drying Time |\n|------------|-------------|\n| Warm, dry, ventilated | 12-24 hours |\n| Cool or humid | 24-48 hours |\n| Hot mud (setting type) | Per product (20-90 min) |\n\n> **Test Before Coating:** Compound should be uniformly white/light color when dry. Dark spots indicate moisture."

Cut bead to length (snips)\n2. Position on corner\n3. Crimp flanges into drywall\n4. Check for plumb/straight\n\n**Nail-On:**\n1. Position bead on corner\n2. Nail through holes, 6\" apart\n3. Alternate sides\n4. Don't overdrive nails\n\n**Adhesive/Compound:**\n1. Apply compound to corner\n2. Press bead into compound\n3. Squeeze out excess\n4. Staple to hold while drying\n\n### Paper-Faced Corner Bead\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Better blend with wall\n- Less visible if damaged\n- Compound keys to paper\n\n**Installation:**\n1. Apply compound to corner (both sides)\n2. Position bead, press into compound\n3. Wipe down both sides\n4. Embed paper fully in compound\n5. Remove excess compound\n\n### Finishing Corner Bead\n\n**Three-Coat Process:**\n\n| Coat | Width | Focus |\n|------|-------|-------|\n| First | 4\" | Fill to metal nose |\n| Second | 6-8\" | Feather and blend |\n| Third | 8-10\" | Final smoothness |\n\n**Technique:**\n- Knife rides on metal nose and wall\n- Creates smooth transition\n- Don't fill over metal nose\n- Feather outer edge to wall\n\n### Specialty Beads\n\n**L-Bead (Reveal):**\n- Creates shadow line at transitions\n- No finishing required\n- Used at windows, ceilings\n\n**J-Bead:**\n- Finished edge where drywall ends\n- Around openings, panels\n\n**Archway Bead:**\n- Flexible for curved corners\n- Cut flanges for tight curves\n- Install like standard bead"

Long, even strokes\n2. Follow joint direction\n3. Feather at edges\n4. Don't over-sand (exposes tape)\n\n**For Screw Spots:**\n- Circular motion\n- Light pressure\n- Don't create dish\n\n**For Corners:**\n- Use folded sandpaper or corner tool\n- One side at a time\n- Don't round the corner\n\n### Dust Control\n\n**Options:**\n- Dust-control compound (less dust when sanding)\n- Vacuum-attached sander\n- Wet sanding with sponge\n- Seal off area, use air scrubber\n\n### Final Inspection\n\n**Check with side light:**\n- Position light at 10-15° angle\n- Look for shadows, imperfections\n- Mark problems with pencil\n- Touch up and re-sand\n\n**Checklist:**\n- [ ] All joints invisible under side light\n- [ ] Screw spots completely blended\n- [ ] Corners straight and smooth\n- [ ] No ridges or tool marks\n- [ ] Surface uniformly smooth\n- [ ] All dust removed\n\n### Priming\n\n**Why Prime Drywall:**\n- Seals compound (different porosity than paper)\n- Ensures uniform paint absorption\n- Reveals remaining imperfections\n- Required before paint\n\n**Primer Selection:**\n- PVA primer: Standard, economical\n- High-build primer: Fills minor imperfections\n- Shellac-based: Blocks stains, odors"
