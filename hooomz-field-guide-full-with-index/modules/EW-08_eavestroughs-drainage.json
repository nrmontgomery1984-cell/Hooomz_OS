Vinyl should be avoided in NB due to brittleness in cold.\n\n### Profile Types\n\n**K-Style (Ogee):**\n- Most common residential profile\n- Decorative front face\n- Available in 5\" and 6\" widths\n- Handles more water than half-round\n\n**Half-Round:**\n- Traditional/historic appearance\n- Easier to clean\n- Less capacity than K-style\n- Often used with copper\n\n**Box/Commercial:**\n- Maximum capacity\n- Used for large roof areas\n- Industrial appearance\n\n### Sizing Guidelines\n\n| Roof Area | Minimum Gutter | Minimum Downspout |\n|-----------|----------------|-------------------|\n| Up to 600 sq ft | 5\" K-style | 2\" x 3\" |\n| 600-1000 sq ft | 5\" K-style | 3\" x 4\" |\n| Over 1000 sq ft | 6\" K-style | 3\" x 4\" or 4\" round |\n\n**One downspout per 40 linear feet of gutter maximum**"

      "content_md": "## Installation Fundamentals\n\n### Slope Requirements\n\n**Proper Slope:**\n- Minimum 1/16\" per foot toward downspout\n- Recommended 1/8\" per foot for heavy rain areas\n- Maximum run: 40 feet to single downspout\n\n**Setting Slope:**\n1. Mark high point at gutter start\n2. Calculate drop (length x slope)\n3. Mark low point at downspout\n4. Snap chalk line between points\n5. Install hangers along line\n\n**Example:** 32' gutter run at 1/8\" per foot\n- Drop = 32 x 0.125 = 4 inches total\n- High end 4\" above low end\n\n### Hanger Types & Spacing\n\n| Hanger Type | Best For | Spacing |\n|-------------|----------|--------|\n| **Hidden Hangers** | K-style, clean look | 24\" OC (18\" in snow areas) |\n| **Spike & Ferrule** | Old-style, repairs | 24\" OC |\n| **Strap Hangers** | Half-round, metal roofs | 30\" OC |\n| **Fascia Brackets** | No fascia board | 24\" OC |\n\n> **Zone 6 Critical:** Use 18\" hanger spacing in NB to support ice and snow loads. Standard 24\" spacing leads to sagging and failure.\n\n### Fascia Board Requirements\n\n**Proper Backing:**\n- Fascia must be solid (not rotted)\n- Minimum 1\" thick nominal lumber\n- Paint/prime before gutter installation\n- Repair any soft spots\n\n**Drip Edge Integration:**\n- Back edge of gutter tucks under drip edge\n- Water flows from roof directly into gutter\n- No gap between drip edge and gutter back\n\n### End Cap & Seam Sealing\n\n**Sealing Requirements:**\n- Apply gutter sealant to all seams\n- Both inside and outside of joints\n- End caps sealed before installation\n- Use silicone or butyl-based sealant"

      "content_md": "## Downspouts & Extensions\n\n### Downspout Placement\n\n**Location Guidelines:**\n- At low points of gutter runs\n- Away from walkways and entries\n- Near drainage areas\n- Not directly against foundation\n\n**Frequency:**\n- One per 40' of gutter (maximum)\n- Additional at valleys and corners\n- Large roof sections may need more\n\n### Connection to Gutter\n\n**Outlet Installation:**\n1. Mark outlet location on gutter bottom\n2. Cut hole with snips or hole saw\n3. Insert drop outlet from top\n4. Crimp tabs and seal joints\n\n**Elbow Configuration:**\n- Two elbows typically needed\n- \"A\" elbow at gutter (front-facing)\n- \"B\" elbow at wall (side-facing)\n- Short section between elbows\n\n### Securing Downspouts\n\n**Strap Spacing:**\n- Top: At elbow connection\n- Middle: Every 10 feet\n- Bottom: 12\" above discharge\n\n**Fastening:**\n- Use appropriate fasteners for siding type\n- Pre-drill to prevent cracking\n- Stainless screws for aluminum downspouts\n\n### Discharge Requirements\n\n**Extensions Minimum:**\n- 4 feet from foundation (code minimum)\n- 6-10 feet recommended\n- Direct to drainage swale if possible\n\n**Extension Options:**\n\n| Type | Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|------|\n| **Rigid Extension** | Durable, permanent | Visible, trip hazard |\n| **Flip-Up** | Folds for mowing | Can get stuck down |\n| **Roll-Out** | Auto-deploys | May not roll back |\n| **Underground Pipe** | Hidden, effective | Cost, clogging |\n| **Splash Block** | Simple, cheap | Minimal protection |\n\n> **Best Practice:** Underground drainage to daylight (exposed pipe away from foundation) is the most reliable solution for NB's heavy rain events."

Consider heated cables with guards.\n\n### Regular Maintenance Schedule\n\n**Spring:**\n- Clear winter debris\n- Check for ice damage\n- Verify slope and alignment\n- Flush system with hose\n\n**Fall:**\n- Remove leaves and debris\n- Check and clear downspouts\n- Inspect seams and end caps\n- Verify extensions in place\n\n**After Storms:**\n- Clear debris buildup\n- Check for damage\n- Verify drainage function\n\n### Cleaning Procedure\n\n1. **Safety First**\n   - Stable ladder, proper angle\n   - Gloves and eye protection\n   - Spotter if possible\n\n2. **Remove Debris**\n   - Scoop out by hand or trowel\n   - Work toward downspout\n   - Bag debris as you go\n\n3. **Flush System**\n   - Garden hose from high end\n   - Verify water flows to downspout\n   - Check for leaks at seams\n\n4. **Clear Downspouts**\n   - Flush from top\n   - Use plumber's snake if clogged\n   - Verify discharge at extension\n\n### Ice Dam Prevention\n\n**Heat Cables:**\n- Self-regulating type preferred\n- Zigzag pattern along eave edge\n- Run through gutters and downspouts\n- Thermostat control for efficiency\n\n**Installation Pattern:**\n- Loops extend 12-24\" up roof\n- Cable in gutter bottom\n- Down entire downspout length\n- Power source with GFCI protection"

      "content_md": "## Troubleshooting & Repairs\n\n### Common Problems\n\n**1. Overflowing Gutters**\n\n| Cause | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| Debris buildup | Clean gutters and downspouts |\n| Insufficient slope | Re-hang with proper pitch |\n| Undersized system | Upgrade to larger gutters/downspouts |\n| Too few downspouts | Add additional downspouts |\n\n**2. Leaking Seams**\n\n| Cause | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| Old sealant failure | Clean and re-seal joints |\n| Physical damage | Patch or replace section |\n| Thermal movement | Use flexible sealant |\n\n**3. Sagging Gutters**\n\n| Cause | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| Hanger spacing too wide | Add intermediate hangers |\n| Ice/snow damage | Replace bent sections, add hangers |\n| Rotted fascia | Repair fascia, reinstall |\n\n**4. Water Behind Gutter**\n\n| Cause | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| Missing drip edge | Install proper drip edge |\n| Gutter too low | Raise gutter to catch drip edge |\n| Gap at back | Seal or adjust positioning |\n\n### Repair Techniques\n\n**Sealing Leaks:**\n1. Clean area thoroughly (remove old sealant)\n2. Dry completely\n3. Apply gutter sealant liberally\n4. Smooth with gloved finger\n5. Allow cure before water exposure\n\n**Patching Holes:**\n- Small holes: Roofing cement + mesh patch\n- Larger damage: Aluminum patch riveted and sealed\n- Severe damage: Replace section\n\n**Re-sloping:**\n1. Remove old hangers\n2. Mark new slope line\n3. Fill old screw holes\n4. Install new hangers along line\n5. Verify water flow\n\n### When to Replace\n\n**Signs It's Time:**\n- Multiple sections with holes\n- Extensive rust (steel gutters)\n- Severe sagging throughout\n- Seams pulling apart repeatedly\n- Paint peeling/chalking severely\n\n> **Upgrade Tip:** When replacing, consider upgrading to seamless gutters. More expensive initially but fewer leak points and longer lifespan."
