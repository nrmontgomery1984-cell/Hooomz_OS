Clean and prepare concrete surface\n2. Fill honeycombs and voids\n3. Apply primer if required\n4. Spray or roller-apply membrane\n5. Build to required thickness (60+ mils)\n6. Install protection board\n\n**Pros:**\n- Seamless coverage\n- Conforms to irregular surfaces\n- Self-healing (some products)\n\n**Cons:**\n- Weather dependent application\n- Thickness verification needed\n- Quality depends on applicator skill\n\n### Sheet Membranes\n\n**Types:**\n- Self-adhering (peel-and-stick)\n- Heat-welded (torch applied)\n- Mechanically fastened\n\n**Application:**\n1. Surface must be clean, dry, smooth\n2. Apply primer per manufacturer\n3. Roll out membrane horizontally\n4. Overlap seams 3-4\" minimum\n5. Roll firmly for adhesion\n6. Seal all penetrations\n\n**Pros:**\n- Consistent thickness\n- Visible coverage verification\n- Factory quality control\n\n**Cons:**\n- Seams are potential weak points\n- Requires smoother substrate\n- Temperature sensitive application\n\n### Drainage Mat Systems\n\n**Components:**\n- Dimpled HDPE core\n- Geotextile fabric filter\n- Provides drainage plane\n\n**Installation:**\n- Over waterproofing membrane\n- Dimples face wall\n- Fabric faces soil\n- Overlaps minimum 4\"\n- Extends to footer drain\n\n> **Best Practice:** In Zone 6, combine waterproofing membrane WITH drainage mat for maximum protection against NB's wet conditions."

Clean joint thoroughly\n2. Apply hydraulic cement cove\n3. Shape 45° or rounded profile\n4. Minimum 2\" leg each direction\n5. Allow to cure\n6. Extend membrane over cove\n\n### Penetration Preparation\n\n**Pipes, conduits, anchors:**\n- Clean around penetration\n- Apply compatible sealant\n- Install boot or collar\n- Integrate with membrane system\n\n> **Critical:** All penetrations must be sealed BEFORE membrane application. Adding waterproofing around existing penetrations requires extra detail."
