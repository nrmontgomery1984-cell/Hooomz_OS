      "content": "## Interior Trim Materials\n\nSelecting appropriate trim materials depends on budget, paint/stain finish, and moisture exposure.\n\n### Wood Species\n\n| Species | Characteristics | Best For |\n|---------|-----------------|----------|\n| Pine | Soft, affordable, paintable | Paint-grade trim |\n| Poplar | Harder, smooth grain | Paint-grade, high-wear areas |\n| Oak | Hard, prominent grain | Stain-grade traditional |\n| Maple | Very hard, fine grain | Stain-grade contemporary |\n| MDF | Uniform, no grain | Paint-grade, moisture-free |\n\n### Profile Styles\n\n**Traditional Profiles:**\n- Colonial casing (curved profile)\n- Victorian (ornate details)\n- Craftsman (square edges)\n\n**Contemporary Profiles:**\n- Flat stock (simple, clean)\n- Eased edge (slightly rounded)\n- Shaker style (minimal detail)\n\n### Material Grades\n\n| Grade | Description | Application |\n|-------|-------------|-------------|\n| Clear | No knots, uniform | Stain-grade finish |\n| Paint Grade | Small knots, filled | Painted finish |\n| Finger-jointed | Joined short pieces | Paint-grade, economical |\n| Primed MDF | Factory primed | Paint-grade, stable |\n\n> **Pro Tip:** In NB Zone 6, solid wood trim in bathrooms may cup or warp. Consider PVC or primed MDF for moisture-prone areas."

Check blade perpendicular to fence\n2. Verify 45° stops accurate\n3. Support long pieces with stands\n4. Use stop blocks for repetitive cuts\n\n**Brad Nailer Settings:**\n- Depth adjustment for material\n- Test on scrap first\n- Slightly countersink for filling"

      "title": "Baseboard Installation",
      "content": "## Professional Baseboard Installation\n\nBaseboards protect wall bases and provide visual transition between wall and floor.\n\n### Planning & Measurement\n\n1. **Room survey** - Measure all walls\n2. **Add waste** - 10-15% for cuts\n3. **Plan joints** - Inside corners coped, outside mitred\n4. **Mark studs** - Transfer to baseboard height\n\n### Inside Corner Methods\n\n**Coped Joint (Preferred):**\n1. Cut first piece square to wall\n2. Cut second piece at 45° (profile exposed)\n3. Back-cut profile with coping saw\n4. Test fit and adjust\n\n**Why cope vs. mitre inside corners:**\n- Accommodates out-of-square corners\n- Won't open gaps when walls settle\n- Cleaner appearance long-term\n\n### Outside Corner Mitres\n\n1. Measure to corner point\n2. Cut 45° mitre (test with scrap)\n3. Dry fit both pieces\n4. Adjust angle if corner not 90°\n5. Glue joint and nail both sides\n\n### Installation Sequence\n\n1. Start with longest wall (square cut both ends)\n2. Work around room with coped inside corners\n3. Install outside corner pieces together\n4. Fill nail holes\n5. Caulk top edge to wall\n\n### Fastening\n\n| Wall Type | Fastener | Spacing |\n|-----------|----------|----------|\n| Stud locations | 2\" brad nails | 16\" o.c. |\n| No stud access | Construction adhesive + nails | Continuous |\n| Outside corners | Nail both directions | Cross-nail |\n\n> **Pro Tip:** Always leave a 1/16\" gap at floor for expansion. This gap is hidden by flooring or floor finish."

      "title": "Door & Window Casing",
      "content": "## Casing Installation Techniques\n\nDoor and window casings frame openings and conceal jamb-to-wall transitions.\n\n### Reveal Layout\n\nThe reveal is the setback from jamb edge to casing edge (typically 3/16\" to 1/4\").\n\n**Setting Reveal:**\n1. Mark reveal line on all jamb edges\n2. Use combination square for consistency\n3. Transfer marks to head and legs\n\n### Standard Casing Methods\n\n**Mitred Casing:**\n1. Measure head piece (jamb + 2 reveals + mitre allowance)\n2. Cut 45° mitres on both ends\n3. Measure leg pieces (floor to head reveal + mitre)\n4. Cut 45° at top, square at bottom\n5. Install head first, then legs\n\n**Butt Joint Casing:**\n1. Install head piece with square cuts\n2. Butt legs against bottom of head\n3. Simpler for beginners\n4. Works with square-edged profiles\n\n### Door Casing Specifics\n\n| Measurement | Method |\n|-------------|--------|\n| Head length | Jamb width + 2 reveals + 1/16\" |\n| Leg length | Floor to head reveal line |\n| Reveal | 3/16\" - 1/4\" from jamb edge |\n\n### Window Casing\n\n**With Stool & Apron:**\n1. Install stool (extends past casing width)\n2. Case head and sides to stool\n3. Install apron beneath stool\n\n**Picture Frame Style:**\n- Four mitred pieces\n- No stool or apron\n- Contemporary appearance\n\n### Fastening Casing\n\n- Nail through casing into jamb (interior)\n- Nail through casing into framing (exterior edge)\n- Use 15-gauge for thick casings, 18-gauge for thin\n- Pre-drill hardwoods to prevent splitting"

      "title": "Fitting & Finishing Details",
      "content": "## Professional Finishing Techniques\n\nAttention to detail separates professional trim work from amateur installations.\n\n### Dealing with Out-of-Square\n\n**Walls:**\n- Use bevel gauge to measure actual angle\n- Split difference between pieces\n- Back-cut to improve fit\n\n**Floors:**\n- Scribe baseboard to uneven floor\n- Use compass to transfer profile\n- Cut with jigsaw following scribe line\n\n### Gap Filling\n\n| Gap Size | Solution |\n|----------|----------|\n| < 1/16\" | Caulk |\n| 1/16\" - 1/8\" | Wood filler |\n| > 1/8\" | Recut or shim |\n\n### Caulking\n\n**Where to Caulk:**\n- Top of baseboard to wall\n- Inside corners (after coping)\n- Casing to wall surfaces\n\n**Caulking Technique:**\n1. Cut tip at 45° angle\n2. Apply consistent bead\n3. Tool with wet finger\n4. Clean excess immediately\n\n### Nail Hole Filling\n\n**Paint-Grade:**\n1. Use lightweight spackle\n2. Overfill slightly\n3. Sand flush after drying\n\n**Stain-Grade:**\n1. Match wood filler to stain\n2. Test on scrap first\n3. Apply after staining\n\n### Pre-Finishing\n\nPre-finishing trim before installation:\n- Back-prime all pieces\n- Apply finish coats\n- Touch up after installation\n- Saves time on ladders\n\n> **Pro Tip:** For stain-grade trim, number pieces and their locations. Pre-stain, then install. Touch up nail holes with matching putty stick after installation."
