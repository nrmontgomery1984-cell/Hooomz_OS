      "content": "## Common Flooring Materials\n\nChoosing the right flooring depends on room use, moisture exposure, budget, and desired appearance.\n\n### Flooring Comparison\n\n| Type | Durability | Moisture Resistance | Installation | Cost |\n|------|------------|---------------------|--------------|------|\n| Solid Hardwood | High | Low | Nail/Staple | $$$$ |\n| Engineered Wood | High | Moderate | Float/Glue/Nail | $$$ |\n| Laminate | Medium | Low | Float | $$ |\n| Luxury Vinyl Plank | High | Excellent | Float/Glue | $$ |\n| Sheet Vinyl | Medium | Excellent | Glue | $ |\n\n### Solid Hardwood\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- 3/4\" thick solid wood throughout\n- Can be refinished multiple times\n- Expands/contracts with humidity\n- Must acclimate 3-5 days minimum\n\n### Engineered Hardwood\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Real wood veneer over plywood core\n- More dimensionally stable\n- Limited refinishing (1-2 times)\n- Better for basements with proper vapor barrier\n\n### Luxury Vinyl Plank (LVP/LVT)\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Waterproof core\n- Realistic wood/stone appearance\n- Click-lock or glue-down\n- Excellent for basements, kitchens, bathrooms\n\n> **Pro Tip:** In NB Zone 6, relative humidity swings seasonally. Engineered flooring or LVP handles these changes better than solid hardwood in problematic areas."

      "title": "Subfloor Preparation",
      "content": "## Preparing the Subfloor\n\nProper subfloor preparation is critical for a successful flooring installation. Most flooring failures trace back to inadequate prep.\n\n### Subfloor Requirements\n\n| Condition | Requirement | Method |\n|-----------|-------------|--------|\n| Flatness | 3/16\" in 10' | Check with straight edge |\n| Moisture | Per flooring specs | Moisture meter test |\n| Cleanliness | Debris-free | Sweep and vacuum |\n| Fastening | Secure to joists | Screw down squeaky spots |\n\n### Concrete Subfloors\n\n**Moisture Testing:**\n1. Calcium chloride test (surface moisture)\n2. Relative humidity test (slab moisture)\n3. Plastic sheet test (24-hour visual)\n\n**Maximum Moisture Levels:**\n- Hardwood: 4-6% WME or 75% RH\n- LVP: Varies by manufacturer (often 85% RH)\n- Laminate: 6-9% WME\n\n### Plywood Subfloors\n\n**Preparation Steps:**\n1. Check for squeaks - screw down to joists\n2. Fill gaps and voids with floor patch\n3. Sand high spots\n4. Clean thoroughly\n\n### Leveling Compounds\n\n**When Needed:**\n- Low spots deeper than 3/16\"\n- Uneven concrete\n- Preparing for thin flooring\n\n**Application:**\n1. Prime substrate\n2. Mix self-leveler per instructions\n3. Pour and spread\n4. Allow full cure (24-48 hours typical)\n\n> **Pro Tip:** Always check moisture levels on concrete slabs, even if they seem dry. Moisture vapor can destroy flooring from below within months."

      "title": "Hardwood & Engineered Installation",
      "content": "## Installing Hardwood Flooring\n\nHardwood installation requires acclimation, proper fastening, and careful attention to expansion gaps.\n\n### Acclimation\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Store in installation room\n- Cross-stack with spacers\n- 3-5 days minimum (longer for solid)\n- Room at normal living conditions\n\n### Expansion Gaps\n\n| Room Dimension | Perimeter Gap |\n|----------------|---------------|\n| Under 20' | 1/2\" |\n| 20' - 40' | 3/4\" |\n| Over 40' | 1\" or expansion strip |\n\n### Installation Methods\n\n**Nail-Down (Solid Hardwood):**\n- Use flooring nailer/stapler\n- Nail schedule: 6-8\" intervals\n- Minimum 1-2\" from ends\n- Face-nail first rows, plug holes\n\n**Glue-Down (Engineered):**\n- Apply adhesive with trowel\n- Work in sections\n- Weight planks while curing\n- Full cure before traffic (24-48 hours)\n\n**Floating (Engineered/Laminate):**\n- Install over underlayment\n- Click-lock planks together\n- No attachment to subfloor\n- Fastest installation method\n\n### Installation Sequence\n\n1. Establish starting wall (straightest)\n2. Snap chalk line for first row\n3. Install first row with spacers at wall\n4. Stagger end joints 6\" minimum\n5. Rack boards for color/grain variation\n6. Cut final row to fit\n7. Install transitions and baseboard\n\n> **Pro Tip:** Racking out several boxes of flooring before starting helps blend color variations and avoids clusters of similar-looking planks."

      "title": "Luxury Vinyl Plank Installation",
      "content": "## LVP/LVT Installation\n\nLuxury vinyl plank combines easy installation with excellent moisture resistance, making it popular for all room types.\n\n### Types of LVP\n\n| Type | Core | Best For |\n|------|------|----------|\n| SPC (Stone) | Rigid stone composite | Heavy traffic, commercial |\n| WPC (Wood) | Wood composite | Residential comfort |\n| Rigid Core | Dense polymer | General purpose |\n| Glue-Down | No core | Permanent installation |\n\n### Subfloor Requirements\n\n**Critical Factors:**\n- Flatness: 3/16\" in 10' radius\n- Small debris shows through\n- Temperature: 65-85°F during install\n- Must be clean and dry\n\n### Installation Process\n\n**Floating Click-Lock:**\n1. Install appropriate underlayment\n2. Start from corner with spacers\n3. Angle and click long edges\n4. Tap end joints with rubber mallet\n5. Stagger end joints 6-8\" minimum\n6. Maintain expansion gaps\n\n**Glue-Down:**\n1. Apply pressure-sensitive adhesive\n2. Allow flash time per product\n3. Set planks into adhesive\n4. Roll with floor roller\n5. No gap needed (planks glued)\n\n### Transitions\n\n| Location | Transition Type |\n|----------|----------------|\n| Room to room (same level) | T-moulding |\n| Room to room (different level) | Reducer |\n| At exterior doors | Threshold |\n| At carpet | Carpet edge/reducer |\n| At stairs | Stair nose |\n\n### Temperature Considerations\n\n**In NB Zone 6:**\n- Acclimate 48 hours\n- Don't install on cold concrete\n- Allow heating system to run normally\n- Rigid core more stable in temperature swings\n\n> **Pro Tip:** LVP can be installed over most existing hard floors (tile, concrete, wood) if they're flat and in good condition. This saves demolition time and cost."

      "title": "Finishing & Transitions",
      "content": "## Completing the Flooring Installation\n\nProfessional results require proper transitions, trim work, and attention to details.\n\n### Baseboard Installation\n\n**Options:**\n- Reinstall existing baseboard\n- Install new baseboard over floor gap\n- Use shoe moulding with existing baseboard\n\n**Shoe Moulding:**\n- Covers expansion gap\n- Nail to baseboard, not floor\n- Allows floor to move freely\n\n### Door Undercuts\n\n**Proper Method:**\n1. Measure flooring + underlayment thickness\n2. Use jamb saw or oscillating tool\n3. Cut door casing at floor level\n4. Slide flooring under casing\n5. Clean, professional appearance\n\n### Common Transitions\n\n**T-Moulding:**\n- Same height floors meeting\n- Uses track screwed to subfloor\n- Snaps into track\n\n**Reducer:**\n- Floor to lower surface\n- Gradual height transition\n- Required by code for trip hazards\n\n**Stair Nosing:**\n- Top of stairs\n- Matches floor profile\n- Must be securely fastened\n\n### Expansion & Contraction\n\n**Managing Movement:**\n- Never pin flooring against fixed objects\n- Cut around pipes with clearance\n- Use flexible caulk at tub/shower\n- Expansion strips in large areas\n\n### Quality Checklist\n\n| Item | Check For |\n|------|------------|\n| Gaps | No visible gaps between planks |\n| Lippage | No height differences at joints |\n| Squeak | No noise when walking |\n| Movement | Floor doesn't shift or bounce |\n| Appearance | Consistent color, no damage |\n\n> **Pro Tip:** Take photos of the subfloor and installation process. If warranty issues arise, documentation proves proper preparation was done."
