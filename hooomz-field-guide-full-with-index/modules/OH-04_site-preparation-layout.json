      "content_md": "## What is Site Preparation & Layout?\n\nSite preparation and layout is the critical first step in residential construction that transforms a raw building lot into a precisely measured construction site. It encompasses all activities required to:\n\n- Verify property boundaries and setbacks\n- Establish accurate reference points (benchmarks)\n- Transfer building dimensions from plans to the ground\n- Set foundation layout with proper squareness and elevation\n- Mark excavation limits and grade stakes\n- Implement erosion and sediment control measures\n\nFor New Brunswick residential construction, this phase is particularly critical due to:\n- Significant frost depth requirements (6 feet in Zone 6)\n- Variable soil conditions (clay, till, bedrock)\n- Seasonal construction challenges (freeze-thaw cycles)\n- Municipal setback and lot coverage requirements\n- Drainage and grading requirements for cold climate\n\n## Why Does It Matter?\n\n### Accuracy Impacts Everything:\n- **Foundation position:** Even 6\" error can violate setbacks ($5,000+ to correct)\n- **Squareness:** Out-of-square foundation = every wall, floor, and roof affected\n- **Elevation:** Wrong grade = drainage problems, flooding, foundation issues\n- **Layout errors compound:** Small mistake at layout = major problems at framing\n\n### Legal & Code Compliance:\n- NBC 2020 requires foundations be located per approved plans\n- Municipal bylaws specify minimum setbacks (typically 6-20' from property lines)\n- Survey certificate required before foundation pour in most NB municipalities\n- Errors discovered after construction = stop work orders, demolition, legal liability\n\n### Cost & Schedule:\n- Proper layout prevents rework (demo and rebuild = 3x original cost)\n- Accurate excavation prevents over-dig (waste) or under-dig (delays)\n- Correct elevations prevent drainage fixes after construction\n- Professional layout = smooth inspections and fewer callbacks\n\n### Professional Reputation:\n- Building inspectors check layout first - sets tone for entire project\n- Surveyor certification protects against future boundary disputes\n- Accurate work = trust from trades, engineers, and clients\n- Layout mistakes visible forever (crooked houses, drainage issues)\n\n## Certification Requirements\n\nTo receive Hooomz Apprentice Certification in Site Preparation & Layout, you must:\n\n1. Complete this entire field guide\n2. Pass the review questions with 80% or higher (12/15 correct)\n3. Complete a practical layout assessment:\n   - Set up and level a builder's transit or laser level\n   - Establish a benchmark and transfer elevations\n   - Layout a 24' x 32' foundation with 3-4-5 squaring method\n   - Install batter boards and string lines\n   - Set grade stakes with cut/fill markings\n4. Demonstrate understanding of:\n   - Reading site plans and legal surveys\n   - Call Before You Dig (utility locate) procedures\n   - Erosion and sediment control basics\n\n> **This certification is REQUIRED before participating in foundation layout or excavation work.**\n\n## Layout Overview - From Plans to Ground\n\nThe layout process follows a logical sequence:\n\n1. **Site Assessment** - Verify existing conditions, locate utilities, identify hazards\n2. **Establish Benchmarks** - Create permanent elevation references\n3. **Transfer Dimensions** - Mark building corners from property lines or survey stakes\n4. **Check Squareness** - Use 3-4-5 method or diagonal measurements\n5. **Install Batter Boards** - Create adjustable string line reference system\n6. **Mark Excavation** - Transfer building lines to ground with offset stakes\n7. **Set Grade Stakes** - Mark cut/fill elevations for excavation and grading\n8. **Implement Erosion Control** - Install silt fence, stabilize slopes, manage runoff\n\n## New Brunswick Climate Considerations\n\n### Zone 6 Frost Depth:\n- Minimum foundation depth: 6 feet below finished grade\n- Footings must bear on undisturbed soil or engineered fill\n- Spring construction: Wait for frost to leave ground (April-May)\n- Fall construction: Foundation must be backfilled and graded before freeze-up\n\n### Seasonal Challenges:\n\n**Spring (April-May):**\n- High water table (dewatering often required)\n- Soft ground conditions (equipment rutting)\n- Frost heave damage to stakes (reset as needed)\n\n**Summer (June-August):**\n- Ideal construction window\n- Erosion control critical during rain events\n- Dust control on dry sites\n\n**Fall (September-October):**\n- Race against freeze-up (foundation must be complete)\n- Wet conditions (drainage management essential)\n- Leaves interfere with layout lines (clear regularly)\n\n**Winter (November-March):**\n- Layout difficult (frozen ground, snow cover)\n- Stakes freeze in place (difficult to adjust)\n- Rarely done except for emergency repairs"

      "content_md": "## Essential Layout Tools & Equipment\n\n### Surveying & Leveling Instruments:\n\n**1. Builder's Transit (Optical Level)**\n- 20x-24x magnification optical instrument\n- Mounted on tripod with 360° rotation\n- Accuracy: ±1/8\" over 100 feet\n- Use: Establishing benchmarks, setting elevations, checking grade\n- Cost: $300-800 (professional grade)\n- Advantages: No batteries, very accurate, durable\n- Disadvantages: Requires two-person operation (instrument + rod)\n\n**2. Rotary Laser Level**\n- Self-leveling laser that projects 360° horizontal plane\n- Accuracy: ±1/16\" over 100 feet (professional models)\n- Use: Setting forms, checking excavation, grading, one-person operation\n- Cost: $400-2,000 (rental: $40-60/day)\n- Advantages: One-person operation, works in all directions simultaneously\n- Disadvantages: Requires batteries, difficult to see in bright sun, fragile\n\n**3. Laser Detector/Receiver**\n- Mounts on grade rod to \"catch\" laser beam\n- Beeps when on-grade (faster/slower beeps indicate high/low)\n- Essential for outdoor laser use (can't see beam in daylight)\n- Cost: $100-300\n\n**4. Builder's Level Rod (Grade Rod)**\n- Telescoping rod with graduated measurements\n- Typically extends to 12' or 16'\n- Metric or imperial markings (use same as plans)\n- Read to 1/8\" accuracy\n- Cost: $80-200\n\n**5. Long Tape Measures**\n- 100' fiberglass tape (doesn't stretch, weather resistant)\n- 50' steel tape (more accurate but can rust)\n- Both required for layout work\n- Cost: $30-80 each\n\n**6. String Line & Line Level**\n- Heavy-duty nylon string (mason's line)\n- String level (bubble level that hooks on string)\n- Use: Temporary layout lines, checking level over distance\n- Accuracy: ±1/4\" over 50 feet (less accurate than transit)\n- Cost: $15-30\n\n### Hand Tools & Accessories:\n\n| Tool | Use | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|\n| Framing Square (24\") | Checking right angles, marking | Essential for 3-4-5 method |\n| Plumb Bob (16 oz) | Transferring points vertically | Mark ground from string line |\n| Spray Paint (marking) | Mark layout on ground | Use bright colors (orange, pink) |\n| Lumber Crayon (keel) | Mark stakes and boards | Lasts longer than pencil |\n| Sledge Hammer (8-10 lb) | Driving stakes | Dead-blow for batter boards |\n| Hand Saw or Reciprocating Saw | Cutting stakes and batter boards | Battery recip saw most efficient |\n| 4' and 2' Levels | Checking batter boards, forms | Magnetic levels stick to metal forms |\n| Calculator | Math for diagonals, slopes, cuts | Phone calculator works |\n\n### Stakes & Batter Boards:\n\n**Grade Stakes:**\n- 2x2 or 1x2 lumber, 18-24\" long\n- Pointed at one end for driving\n- Used to mark: corners, excavation limits, elevations\n- Paint or mark with flagging tape for visibility\n\n**Batter Board Stakes:**\n- 2x4 lumber, 3-4' long\n- Pointed at one end\n- Must be strong (will support string lines)\n- Drive 18-24\" into ground for stability\n\n**Batter Board Crosspieces:**\n- 1x4 or 1x6 lumber, 3-4' long\n- Attached horizontally to stakes\n- String lines attached with small nails or saw kerfs\n- Should be level (easier to work with)\n\n**Offset Stakes:**\n- Mark excavation limits (typically 2' beyond foundation)\n- Bright flagging tape for excavator visibility\n- Replaced after excavation with new layout stakes\n\n## Building Science - Grading & Drainage Fundamentals\n\n### Why Grading Matters in NB Climate:\n\nNew Brunswick receives 1,000-1,200 mm annual precipitation, with significant spring runoff from snowmelt. Improper grading causes:\n\n1. **Foundation water infiltration** - Basement flooding, mold, rot\n2. **Frost heave** - Water accumulation under foundation = expansion/cracking\n3. **Soil erosion** - Washed-out landscaping, sedimentation in storm drains\n4. **Ice buildup** - Winter water pooling = ice dams and slipping hazards\n\n### Minimum Grading Requirements (NBC 2020):\n\n**Slope Away from Foundation:**\n- Minimum 5% slope (6\" drop over 10 feet) for first 10 feet\n- Preferred 10% slope (12\" drop over 10 feet) in clay soils\n- Maintain for entire perimeter of building\n- Exceptions require subsurface drainage system\n\n**Finished Grade Elevations:**\n- Top of foundation (TOF) minimum 6\" above finished grade\n- Wood siding minimum 8\" above finished grade\n- Brick veneer minimum 4\" above finished grade (masonry resistant to moisture)\n- Garage slabs typically 2-4\" below house main floor (prevents car exhaust entry)\n\n**Lot Drainage:**\n- Positive drainage away from building to street, rear lot, or swale\n- No ponding or standing water within 10' of foundation\n- Clay soils: Subsurface drainage often required (weeping tile, French drains)\n- Sandy soils: Surface grading usually sufficient\n\n### Erosion & Sediment Control:\n\n**Why It's Required:**\n- Provincial erosion control regulations (NB Clean Environment Act)\n- Prevents sediment from entering storm drains, streams, wetlands\n- Protects adjacent properties from runoff damage\n- Fines for non-compliance: $5,000-$50,000\n\n**Common Control Measures:**\n\n**1. Silt Fence:**\n- Geotextile fabric on wooden or metal stakes\n- Installed downslope of disturbed area\n- Bottom buried 6\" in trench (prevents washout underneath)\n- Inspected weekly and after rain events\n- Removed only after site stabilized (grass growth)\n\n**2. Inlet Protection:**\n- Filter fabric around storm drain inlets\n- Prevents sediment from entering municipal system\n- Required by most NB municipalities\n\n**3. Stabilized Construction Entrance:**\n- Crushed stone pad where equipment enters/exits site\n- Minimum 50' long, 12' wide, 6\" deep stone\n- Prevents mud tracking onto public roads\n- Must clean road if tracking occurs\n\n**4. Temporary Seeding/Mulch:**\n- Stabilize exposed soil that won't be worked for 30+ days\n- Annual ryegrass seed + straw mulch typical\n- Prevents erosion during construction delays\n\n## Code Requirements & Standards\n\n### National Building Code 2020 (NBC):\n\n**Foundation Location & Depth:**\n- Foundations must extend below frost depth (NB Zone 6 = 1.8m / 6 feet)\n- Footings on undisturbed soil or engineered fill (compacted in 8\" lifts)\n- Minimum 12\" projection beyond foundation wall (footing width)\n- Step footings where grade changes (maximum 2' step, 2' horizontal overlap)\n\n**Property Line Setbacks:**\n- Governed by municipal bylaws, NOT NBC\n- Typical NB residential setbacks:\n  - Front yard: 20-30 feet (varies by municipality)\n  - Side yards: 6-10 feet (fire separation requirements)\n  - Rear yard: 20-30 feet\n- Setbacks measured from property line to foundation (not building overhang)\n- Verify with municipal planning department BEFORE layout\n\n**Fire Separation Requirements:**\n- Less than 3 feet from property line: 1-hour fire rating, no openings\n- 3-10 feet: Unprotected openings limited (windows/doors)\n- Over 10 feet: No restrictions\n- Affects foundation placement and window/door locations\n\n### Survey & Layout Standards:\n\n**Legal Survey Required:**\n- New construction: Survey certificate before foundation pour\n- Renovations/additions: Survey if changing building footprint\n- Surveyor establishes property corners with iron pins\n- Survey shows: Property lines, setbacks, easements, existing structures\n\n**Survey Accuracy:**\n- Professional land surveyors accurate to ±1/4\" over 100 feet\n- Builder layout typically ±1/2\" accuracy (acceptable for residential)\n- Foundation contractors typically ±1/4\" on critical dimensions\n\n### Municipal Requirements (Typical NB):\n\n**Development Permit:**\n- Required before construction begins\n- Includes approved site plan showing:\n  - Building location with setback dimensions\n  - Driveway and parking locations\n  - Grading and drainage plan\n  - Tree preservation areas\n  - Utility locations\n\n**Building Permit:**\n- Required before foundation excavation\n- Must be posted on site (visible from street)\n- Inspection required before foundation pour\n- Inspection required at final grading\n\n**Utility Locates:**\n- Call Before You Dig: Contact at least 3 business days before excavation\n- Free service marks underground utilities (power, gas, water, sewer, telecom)\n- Valid for 30 days (must renew if work delayed)\n- Penalties for not calling: $5,000+ fines, liability for damage\n- NB One Call: 1-800-222-4420 or nb1call.com\n\n## Surveying Fundamentals\n\n### Understanding Benchmarks:\n\nA **benchmark** is a permanent reference point with a known elevation. It allows you to:\n- Set consistent elevations across the site\n- Return to the same reference if stakes are disturbed\n- Transfer elevations to different parts of the site\n- Verify excavation depths and final grades\n\n**Types of Benchmarks:**\n\n**1. Temporary Site Benchmark:**\n- Wooden stake or 2x4 driven 18\" into ground in undisturbed area\n- Marked with elevation notation (e.g., \"BM = 100.00\")\n- Located outside construction zone (won't be disturbed)\n- Typical life: Duration of project\n\n**2. Permanent Benchmark:**\n- Concrete monument or iron pin set by surveyor\n- Tied to municipal datum (elevation above sea level)\n- May already exist on site or adjacent property\n- Typical life: Decades\n\n**3. Assumed Benchmark:**\n- When no surveyed elevation exists, assign arbitrary elevation\n- Common practice: Assign \"100.00\" to convenient reference point\n- All other elevations relative to this point\n- Important: Document location and assumed elevation\n\n### Reading a Builder's Level:\n\n**Setup:**\n1. Set up tripod on firm ground (avoid soft spots)\n2. Mount transit/level on tripod\n3. Adjust leveling screws until bubble is centered\n4. Check bubble in multiple directions (should stay centered)\n\n**Taking a Reading:**\n1. Have assistant hold grade rod on benchmark\n2. Sight through instrument to rod\n3. Read where crosshairs intersect rod\n4. Record reading (e.g., 4.35 feet)\n5. This is the \"backsight\" (BS)\n\n**Calculating Height of Instrument (HI):**\n- HI = Benchmark Elevation + Backsight Reading\n- Example: BM = 100.00, BS = 4.35 → HI = 104.35\n- HI is the elevation of the line of sight through the instrument\n\n**Setting Elevations (Foresight):**\n1. Move rod to point where you want to set elevation\n2. Read rod through instrument\n3. This is the \"foresight\" (FS)\n4. Ground elevation = HI - FS\n5. Example: HI = 104.35, FS = 6.20 → Ground = 98.15\n\n**Marking Grade Stakes:**\n- Want to set grade to 99.00\n- Current ground = 98.15\n- Need to fill 0.85 feet (10.2\")\n- Mark stake \"Fill 10\" or \"F 10\"\n\n### The 3-4-5 Squaring Method:\n\nThis is the most reliable field method for creating perfect right angles (90°).\n\n**Principle:**\n- A triangle with sides of 3-4-5 has a 90° angle opposite the longest side\n- Can scale up: 6-8-10, 9-12-15, 12-16-20, etc.\n- Larger triangles = more accurate\n\n**Procedure:**\n1. Establish first wall line (e.g., front of house)\n2. From corner, measure 12' along this line → Mark point A\n3. From same corner, measure 16' perpendicular → Mark point B (approximate)\n4. Measure diagonal from A to B\n5. Adjust point B until diagonal = exactly 20'\n6. Line from corner through B is exactly 90° to first line\n\n**For foundation layout:**\n- Use as large a triangle as possible (30-40-50 or larger)\n- Verify all four corners are square\n- Check diagonals (should be equal if rectangle is square)\n\n### Checking Diagonals:\n\n**For rectangular buildings:**\n- Opposite diagonals must be equal if building is square\n- Measure corner-to-corner both directions\n- Difference should be less than 1/2\" for residential foundation\n- If not equal, adjust corners until diagonals match\n\n**Example:**\n- 24' x 32' foundation\n- Diagonal calculation: √(24² + 32²) = √(576 + 1024) = √1600 = 40.00'\n- Both diagonals should measure 40' 0\"\n- If one diagonal = 40' 1\" and other = 39' 11\", foundation is out of square"

      "content_md": "## PROCEDURE 1: SITE ASSESSMENT & UTILITY LOCATES\n\n### Timeline: 3-7 Days Before Layout\n\nThis procedure MUST be completed before any layout or excavation work begins.\n\n### Step 1: Review Documents (1-2 hours)\n\n**Gather Required Documents:**\n- [ ] Approved building plans (site plan, foundation plan)\n- [ ] Legal survey or property description\n- [ ] Geotechnical report (if available)\n- [ ] Municipal development permit\n- [ ] Utility service locations (if known)\n\n**Verify Key Information:**\n- Building dimensions and footprint\n- Setback requirements from all property lines\n- Finished floor elevation (FFE)\n- Foundation depth requirements\n- Driveway and service connections (water, sewer, power)\n- Easements or restrictions on property\n\n### Step 2: Call Before You Dig - Utility Locates (3+ business days)\n\n**Contact NB One Call:**\n- Phone: 1-800-222-4420\n- Online: nb1call.com\n- Provide: Site address, excavation area, start date, contact info\n- Request locates for: Power, gas, water, sewer, telephone, cable, fiber optic\n\n**Wait for Locates:**\n- Utilities marked within 3 business days (law requires)\n- May take up to 5 days in busy season (spring/summer)\n- Each utility marked with color-coded flags/paint:\n  - **Red** = Electric power\n  - **Orange** = Telephone/cable/fiber\n  - **Yellow** = Natural gas\n  - **Blue** = Water\n  - **Green** = Sewer\n  - **White** = Proposed excavation limits (you mark these)\n  - **Pink** = Survey/layout marks (you mark these)\n\n**Document Utility Locations:**\n- Take photos of all utility markings\n- Sketch on site plan (measure from property corners)\n- Note depth if marked (not always provided)\n- Valid for 30 days (renew if work delayed)\n\n**CRITICAL:** Never excavate until utility locates are complete and you've documented all markings. Hitting a gas line or power cable can be fatal.\n\n### Step 3: Site Walk & Hazard Assessment (1 hour)\n\n**Walk Entire Property:**\n\n**Identify Existing Features:**\n- [ ] Trees to preserve (mark with flagging tape)\n- [ ] Trees to remove (verify with client)\n- [ ] Rock outcrops or ledge (may need blasting)\n- [ ] Wet areas or standing water (drainage issues)\n- [ ] Slopes and grade changes\n- [ ] Adjacent structures (neighbors' garages, wells, septic)\n- [ ] Overhead power lines (clearance for equipment)\n- [ ] Access routes for equipment (width, overhead clearance)\n\n**Soil Conditions (if no geotechnical report):**\n- Dig test holes with shovel or backhoe\n- Note soil type: Sandy (good), clay (poor drainage), till (mixed), bedrock (shallow)\n- Check groundwater depth (water in test hole indicates high water table)\n- Organic soils (black, fibrous) unsuitable for bearing (must be removed)\n\n**Access & Logistics:**\n- [ ] Confirm excavator access route (width, gates, overhead)\n- [ ] Identify material storage locations (topsoil, gravel)\n- [ ] Plan excavated soil placement (stockpile or haul off-site)\n- [ ] Verify street parking or staging area\n\n**Photo Documentation:**\n- Take photos of entire site from multiple angles\n- Focus on: Adjacent properties, trees, existing grades, access points\n- Date and GPS tag photos for records\n\n### Step 4: Locate Property Corners (1-2 hours)\n\n**Find Survey Markers:**\n- Iron pins or survey monuments at property corners\n- May be buried (use metal detector)\n- Sometimes marked with wooden stake (often removed or rotted)\n- If not found, hire surveyor to re-establish (required for new construction)\n\n**Temporary Corner Markers:**\n- Drive 2x2 stakes at each property corner\n- Extend stake 12\" above ground for visibility\n- Mark with bright flagging tape\n- Will be used as reference for layout measurements\n\n**Measure Lot Dimensions:**\n- Verify actual lot size matches legal survey\n- Measure front, rear, and both side property lines\n- Discrepancies = stop and contact surveyor (possible encroachment)\n\n## PROCEDURE 2: ESTABLISHING BENCHMARKS & GRADE REFERENCES\n\n### Timeline: Day 1 of Layout (Morning)\n\nEstablishing accurate benchmarks is the foundation of all elevation control.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Benchmark Location (15 minutes)\n\n**Choose Location That:**\n- Won't be disturbed during excavation or construction\n- Is visible from multiple points on site\n- Is on firm, stable ground (not soft or wet)\n- Is accessible for repeated measurements\n\n**Common Benchmark Locations:**\n- Corner of existing garage or house (if addition/renovation)\n- Large tree outside construction zone\n- Utility pole or hydro meter base\n- Driveway edge or curb (if won't be replaced)\n- Dedicated stake driven in undisturbed area\n\n### Step 2: Set Temporary Benchmark (30 minutes)\n\n**If No Existing Reference:**\n\n1. **Drive benchmark stake:**\n   - Use 2x4 or 4x4, minimum 3 feet long\n   - Drive 18-24\" into firm ground\n   - Top should be 12\" above ground for visibility\n   - Should not move when pushed (very stable)\n\n2. **Mark benchmark elevation:**\n   - Drive nail into top of stake\n   - Use permanent marker to write \"BM = 100.00\" on stake\n   - This is your assumed elevation (arbitrary starting point)\n   - Protect with flagging tape for visibility\n\n**If Surveyed Benchmark Exists:**\n- Verify location matches survey description\n- Note actual elevation (e.g., \"BM = 147.32 m\" above sea level)\n- All site elevations will reference this\n\n### Step 3: Set Up Builder's Transit or Laser Level (20 minutes)\n\n**For Optical Transit:**\n\n1. **Set tripod on firm ground:**\n   - Spread legs to stable width\n   - Adjust leg lengths so head is approximately level\n   - Push legs firmly into ground (should not wobble)\n   - Position within sight of benchmark and work area\n\n2. **Mount instrument:**\n   - Secure transit to tripod head\n   - Adjust leveling screws until bubble is centered\n   - Rotate 90° and check bubble again\n   - Repeat until bubble stays centered in all directions\n\n3. **Verify setup:**\n   - Rotate 360° while watching bubble (should stay centered)\n   - If bubble moves, re-level\n   - Focus eyepiece on crosshairs (sharp focus)\n\n**For Rotary Laser:**\n\n1. **Set up tripod** (same as above)\n2. **Mount laser level** on tripod or grade rod\n3. **Power on** and allow to self-level (15-30 seconds)\n4. **Check level status** (green light = level, red = out of level)\n5. **Set rotation speed** (faster = easier to find, slower = more accurate)\n\n### Step 4: Establish Height of Instrument (10 minutes)\n\n**Take Backsight Reading on Benchmark:**\n\n1. Have assistant hold grade rod on benchmark nail\n2. Sight through transit (or use laser detector on rod)\n3. Read rod where crosshairs intersect (or where detector beeps on-grade)\n4. Record reading: Example: 4.35'\n\n**Calculate Height of Instrument (HI):**\n- HI = Benchmark Elevation + Backsight Reading\n- Example: 100.00 + 4.35 = 104.35'\n- This is the elevation of the instrument's line of sight\n- Record in field notes: \"HI = 104.35\"\n\n**Verify with Second Backsight:**\n- Move rod to different known point (if available)\n- Calculate elevation (should match known value)\n- If off, re-check setup and readings\n\n### Step 5: Set Additional Reference Points (30 minutes)\n\n**Create Secondary Benchmarks:**\n\nUseful if primary benchmark not visible from all parts of site.\n\n1. **Drive stakes** at 2-3 locations around site perimeter\n2. **Take foresight reading** on top of each stake\n3. **Calculate elevation** of each stake: Stake Elev = HI - Foresight\n4. **Mark each stake** with calculated elevation\n5. **Verify** by taking backsight on new stake (should match)\n\n**Example:**\n- HI = 104.35'\n- Foresight on stake = 5.60'\n- Stake elevation = 104.35 - 5.60 = 98.75'\n- Mark stake \"98.75\"\n\n## PROCEDURE 3: FOUNDATION LAYOUT & BATTER BOARDS\n\n### Timeline: Day 1-2 of Layout (4-6 hours for typical house)\n\nThis is the most critical layout procedure - accuracy here affects the entire building.\n\n### Step 1: Locate Building on Site (1 hour)\n\n**From Site Plan, Determine:**\n- Setback from front property line (e.g., 25 feet)\n- Setback from side property lines (e.g., 6 feet each)\n- Building orientation (parallel to street, perpendicular, angled)\n\n**Establish First Reference Line:**\n\nTypically use front of house as primary reference.\n\n1. **Measure setback from front property line:**\n   - Use 100' tape\n   - Measure perpendicular to property line\n   - Example: 25' setback to front of foundation\n   - Drive stake at one corner (Corner A)\n\n2. **Measure side setback:**\n   - From side property line to same corner\n   - Example: 6' setback\n   - Verify corner position is correct distance from BOTH property lines\n   - Adjust stake to exact position\n\n3. **Establish second front corner:**\n   - Measure building width along front (e.g., 32 feet)\n   - Drive stake at second front corner (Corner B)\n   - Verify this corner also meets front and side setback requirements\n\n### Step 2: Square the Building (1 hour)\n\n**Using 3-4-5 Method:**\n\nWe'll create a perfect right angle at Corner A.\n\n1. **Establish baseline (front of house):**\n   - String line from Corner A to Corner B (already set)\n   - This is 32' long (building width)\n\n2. **Measure 12' along baseline from Corner A:**\n   - Mark with stake or spray paint\n   - This is Point 1\n\n3. **Approximate perpendicular line:**\n   - From Corner A, measure 16' at approximately 90° to baseline\n   - Drive temporary stake\n   - This is Point 2 (approximate)\n\n4. **Measure diagonal:**\n   - From Point 1 to Point 2\n   - Should be exactly 20' if angle is 90°\n\n5. **Adjust until perfect:**\n   - Move Point 2 left/right until diagonal = exactly 20.00'\n   - Line from Corner A through Point 2 is exactly 90° to baseline\n\n6. **Extend perpendicular line to rear:**\n   - Measure building depth (e.g., 24 feet) from Corner A\n   - Drive stake at Corner D (rear corner)\n\n### Step 3: Complete the Rectangle (30 minutes)\n\n**Set Fourth Corner:**\n\n1. **From Corner B, measure building depth (24'):**\n   - Use 3-4-5 method to establish 90° angle\n   - Drive stake at Corner C (second rear corner)\n\n2. **Verify with diagonal measurements:**\n   - Measure diagonal A to C\n   - Measure diagonal B to D\n   - Both should be exactly equal\n   - For 24' x 32' building: √(24² + 32²) = 40.00'\n\n3. **Adjust if necessary:**\n   - If diagonals don't match, building is out of square\n   - Move corners C and/or D until diagonals are equal within 1/4\"\n   - Re-check all dimensions after adjustment\n\n**Double-Check All Dimensions:**\n- [ ] Front: 32' 0\" (A to B)\n- [ ] Rear: 32' 0\" (D to C)\n- [ ] Left side: 24' 0\" (A to D)\n- [ ] Right side: 24' 0\" (B to C)\n- [ ] Diagonal A-C: 40' 0\"\n- [ ] Diagonal B-D: 40' 0\"\n- [ ] All setbacks meet requirements\n\n### Step 4: Install Batter Boards (2 hours)\n\n**Purpose of Batter Boards:**\n- Provide adjustable reference for string lines\n- Remain in place when corner stakes removed for excavation\n- Allow easy re-establishment of layout if strings disturbed\n\n**Layout Pattern:**\n- 2 batter boards per corner (forms an \"L\" shape)\n- Set 4-6 feet outside building corners (beyond excavation limits)\n- Tops should be approximately level (easier to work with)\n\n**Installation Procedure:**\n\n**For Each Corner:**\n\n1. **Drive batter board stakes:**\n   - 2x4 stakes, 3-4' long, pointed at one end\n   - Drive 18-24\" into ground\n   - Two stakes per batter board (parallel to building wall)\n   - Space stakes 3-4' apart\n   - Position 4-6' outside corner stake\n\n2. **Check stakes are plumb:**\n   - Use 4' level against stake\n   - Adjust if necessary (remove and re-drive)\n\n3. **Attach crosspiece:**\n   - 1x4 or 1x6 board, 4' long\n   - Position crosspiece level (use 4' level)\n   - Height: Convenient working height (typically 24-36\" above ground)\n   - Screw or nail to stakes (2 screws per stake)\n\n4. **Repeat for second batter board at corner:**\n   - Forms \"L\" shape around corner\n   - Both crosspieces should be at same elevation (check with level)\n\n**Complete All 8 Batter Boards:**\n- 2 per corner x 4 corners = 8 batter boards\n- Check that all crosspieces are approximately level\n- Verify none are loose or wobbly\n\n### Step 5: Attach String Lines (45 minutes)\n\n**String Line Setup:**\n\n1. **Start with one corner (Corner A):**\n   - Stretch string from batter board on one side of corner\n   - To batter board on opposite side (across entire building)\n   - Pull tight (sag = inaccuracy)\n\n2. **Align with corner stake:**\n   - Use plumb bob from string line to corner stake\n   - Adjust string position on batter boards until plumb bob exactly over corner stake\n   - Make small saw kerf in crosspiece and hook string in kerf\n   - Or drive small nail and wrap string around nail\n\n3. **Secure string:**\n   - Tie off to batter board\n   - Should be very tight (no sag)\n   - Test by plucking (should vibrate like guitar string)\n\n4. **Repeat for perpendicular wall:**\n   - Second string line through same corner\n   - Align with plumb bob over corner stake\n   - Secure to batter boards\n\n5. **Complete all four walls:**\n   - 4 string lines total (one per wall)\n   - All should intersect at corners directly over corner stakes\n   - Check with plumb bob at each corner\n\n**Verify Squareness with String Lines:**\n- Measure diagonals between string line intersections\n- Should match (40' 0\" in our example)\n- Adjust string positions on batter boards if necessary\n- Re-check with plumb bob at corners\n\n### Step 6: Mark Excavation Limits (30 minutes)\n\n**Determine Excavation Offset:**\n- Foundation footings typically project 6\" beyond foundation wall\n- Excavation typically 2' beyond footing (working room)\n- Total offset: Foundation wall + 6\" footing + 2' working room = 2' 6\" typically\n\n**Mark Excavation Lines:**\n\n1. **Measure offset from string lines:**\n   - Use measuring tape from string line\n   - Measure perpendicular to string (2' 6\" in this example)\n   - Mark ground with spray paint every 4-6 feet\n\n2. **Drive offset stakes:**\n   - 2x2 stakes, 18\" long\n   - Drive at each corner of excavation area\n   - Mark with bright flagging tape (orange or pink)\n   - These guide excavator operator\n\n3. **Mark with continuous line:**\n   - Spray paint continuous line connecting offset stakes\n   - Use high-visibility color (orange, pink)\n   - This is the \"dig line\" for excavator\n\n**PHOTO STOP #1:** Completed batter boards with string lines and excavation limits marked\n\n## PROCEDURE 4: EXCAVATION LAYOUT & GRADE STAKES\n\n### Timeline: During Excavation & Grading (Ongoing)\n\nGrade stakes guide excavation depth, footing elevation, and final grading.\n\n### Step 1: Set Footing Elevation Stakes (1 hour)\n\n**Before Excavation Begins:**\n\nDetermine required footing elevation from plans.\n\n**Example Calculation:**\n- Finished floor elevation (FFE) = 100.00 (from plans)\n- Floor system depth = 11\" (10\" I-joist + 3/4\" subfloor)\n- Foundation wall height = 8' 0\" (96\")\n- Footing thickness = 8\"\n- Footing top elevation = FFE - 11\" - 96\" - 8\" = 100.00 - 115\" = 100.00 - 9.58' = 90.42'\n\n**Set Grade Stakes:**\n\n1. **Set up instrument at HI = 104.35** (from earlier)\n\n2. **Calculate required foresight reading:**\n   - Want footing top at 90.42'\n   - Foresight needed = HI - Desired Elevation = 104.35 - 90.42 = 13.93'\n\n3. **Drive stakes inside excavation area:**\n   - 4-6 stakes around perimeter\n   - Leave 18\" above current ground\n\n4. **Mark \"cut\" or \"fill\" on each stake:**\n   - Hold rod on ground next to stake\n   - Read foresight (e.g., 8.20')\n   - Ground elevation = 104.35 - 8.20 = 96.15'\n   - Need to excavate to 90.42'\n   - Cut required = 96.15 - 90.42 = 5.73' = 5' 9\" (round to 5' 10\")\n   - Mark stake \"C 5-10\" (Cut 5 feet 10 inches)\n\n5. **Transfer mark to stake:**\n   - Hold rod on ground\n   - Have assistant mark stake where target foresight (13.93') reads\n   - Horizontal mark on stake = finished footing elevation\n   - Write elevation on stake \"90.42\" and \"TOP OF FOOTING\"\n\n**PHOTO STOP #2:** Grade stakes set showing cut/fill marks\n\n### Step 2: Monitor Excavation Progress (Ongoing)\n\n**During Excavation:**\n\n1. **Check depth regularly:**\n   - Set up instrument and take readings on excavation bottom\n   - Compare to target footing elevation\n   - Communicate with excavator operator: \"Down 2 feet more\" or \"6 inches to go\"\n\n2. **Prevent over-excavation:**\n   - Stop excavation 6\" above target (hand-finish to exact elevation)\n   - Over-excavation requires fill (expensive and compaction issues)\n\n3. **Check for soft spots:**\n   - Walk excavation bottom (if safe)\n   - Probe with rod (should be firm)\n   - Soft spots = remove and replace with compacted gravel\n\n4. **Verify bearing soil:**\n   - Should match geotechnical report (if available)\n   - Clay, sand, gravel, till = generally acceptable\n   - Organic soil (black, fibrous) = unsuitable (remove)\n   - Groundwater = may need dewatering pump\n\n### Step 3: Re-Establish Layout After Excavation (1 hour)\n\n**Corner stakes removed during excavation - must re-establish:**\n\n1. **String lines still in place on batter boards** (if protected)\n   - Drop plumb bob from string intersection to excavation bottom\n   - Mark footing corners with stakes or spray paint\n\n2. **If string lines disturbed:**\n   - Re-attach to batter boards using saw kerfs\n   - Check squareness with diagonal measurements\n   - Transfer to excavation bottom with plumb bob\n\n3. **Mark footing forms:**\n   - Footings typically 16\" wide (8\" each side of foundation wall line)\n   - Measure 8\" each side of string line\n   - Mark with spray paint on excavation bottom\n   - These marks guide footing form placement\n\n### Step 4: Set Final Grade Stakes (2-3 hours)\n\n**After Foundation Complete and Backfilled:**\n\nGrade stakes guide final grading to ensure proper drainage.\n\n**Determine Finished Grade Elevations:**\n\nFrom plans, note required grades:\n- Top of foundation (TOF) = typically FFE - 8-12\" (depends on floor system)\n- Finished grade = TOF - 6\" minimum (NBC requirement)\n- Slope away from foundation: 6\" drop over 10 feet (5% slope)\n\n**Example:**\n- TOF = 98.58'\n- Finished grade at foundation = 98.58 - 0.50' = 98.08'\n- 10 feet from foundation = 98.08 - 0.50' = 97.58'\n- 20 feet from foundation = 97.58 - 0.50' = 97.08'\n\n**Install Grade Stakes:**\n\n1. **Grid pattern:**\n   - Stakes every 10-20 feet\n   - Denser grid near foundation (critical drainage area)\n   - Sparser grid further from building\n\n2. **Calculate cut/fill for each stake:**\n   - Set up instrument (HI = 104.35 from earlier)\n   - Hold rod on ground at stake location\n   - Record foresight (e.g., 7.80')\n   - Current ground = HI - FS = 104.35 - 7.80 = 96.55'\n   - Desired grade at this location = 97.58' (10' from foundation)\n   - Fill required = 97.58 - 96.55 = 1.03' = 1' 0\"\n   - Mark stake \"F 1-0\" (Fill 1 foot)\n\n3. **Mark grade on stake:**\n   - Calculate foresight for desired elevation: FS = HI - Desired = 104.35 - 97.58 = 6.77'\n   - Hold rod on stake\n   - Mark stake where rod reads 6.77'\n   - Draw horizontal line across stake\n   - This line = finished grade elevation\n\n4. **Color coding:**\n   - Cut stakes: Red marking\n   - Fill stakes: Blue marking\n   - Makes it easy for equipment operator\n\n**PHOTO STOP #3:** Grade stakes installed showing cut/fill and elevation marks\n\n## PROCEDURE 5: EROSION & SEDIMENT CONTROL INSTALLATION\n\n### Timeline: Before Excavation & Maintained Throughout Construction\n\nErosion control is legally required and prevents environmental damage.\n\n### Step 1: Install Silt Fence (2-3 hours)\n\n**When Required:**\n- Disturbed area within 100 feet of watercourse, wetland, or storm drain\n- Sloped sites (runoff risk)\n- Required by municipal erosion control permit\n\n**Materials Needed:**\n- Silt fence fabric (geotextile, not burlap)\n- Wooden stakes (2x2, 4' long) or metal T-posts\n- Staples or wire ties\n- Trenching tool (spade or trencher)\n\n**Installation Procedure:**\n\n1. **Identify installation location:**\n   - Downslope of disturbed area\n   - Intercepts runoff before it leaves site\n   - Follows contour (perpendicular to water flow)\n\n2. **Dig trench:**\n   - 6\" deep, 4\" wide\n   - Follows planned fence line\n   - Excavated soil placed on downslope side\n\n3. **Drive stakes:**\n   - 2x2 stakes every 6 feet\n   - Drive 18\" into ground (below trench bottom)\n   - Plumb (vertical)\n\n4. **Attach fabric:**\n   - Unroll fabric upslope of stakes\n   - Bottom 6\" of fabric goes into trench\n   - Staple fabric to upslope side of stakes (every 6\")\n   - Fabric height: Minimum 18\" above ground\n\n5. **Backfill trench:**\n   - Place excavated soil over fabric in trench\n   - Compact firmly (foot traffic or hand tamper)\n   - This anchors fabric and prevents washout underneath\n\n6. **Overlap sections:**\n   - Where fabric sections meet, overlap 6\" minimum\n   - Staple overlap securely\n   - No gaps (water will flow through gaps)\n\n**Maintenance:**\n- Inspect weekly and after rain events\n- Repair tears or detached sections immediately\n- Remove accumulated sediment when 1/3 fence height (prevents overflow)\n- Leave in place until site fully stabilized (grass growth)\n\n### Step 2: Install Inlet Protection (30 minutes)\n\n**When Required:**\n- Storm drain inlets within or downslope of site\n- Required by most NB municipalities\n\n**Materials:**\n- Inlet filter bags (gravel-filled fabric bags) OR\n- Silt fence wrapped around stakes forming box around inlet\n\n**Installation:**\n\n1. **Clear area around inlet** (12\" perimeter)\n2. **Install filter** per manufacturer instructions\n3. **Secure to prevent washout** (stakes, sandbags)\n4. **Check weekly** (clean or replace when clogged)\n\n### Step 3: Stabilized Construction Entrance (2-4 hours)\n\n**When Required:**\n- Prevent mud tracking onto public roads\n- Required if site access is from paved road\n\n**Materials:**\n- Crushed stone (3/4\" clear, 6\" depth)\n- Geotextile fabric (underlayment)\n- Length: Minimum 50 feet\n- Width: Minimum 12 feet (for two-way traffic)\n\n**Installation:**\n\n1. **Clear and grade entrance area**\n2. **Lay geotextile fabric** (prevents stone from sinking into soil)\n3. **Spread crushed stone** (6\" depth)\n4. **Maintain:** Add stone as needed, sweep road if tracking occurs\n\n### Step 4: Temporary Seeding/Stabilization (1-2 hours)\n\n**When Required:**\n- Exposed soil that won't be worked for 30+ days\n- Stockpiled topsoil piles\n- Finished slopes before final landscaping\n\n**Materials:**\n- Annual ryegrass seed (fast germination)\n- Straw mulch or erosion control blanket\n- Fertilizer (optional, speeds growth)\n\n**Installation:**\n\n1. **Prepare soil surface** (rake smooth)\n2. **Broadcast seed** (follow bag rate, typically 5 lb/1000 sq ft)\n3. **Apply straw mulch** (2-3\" depth)\n4. **Water if dry** (grass needs moisture to germinate)\n5. **Maintain:** Re-seed bare spots, add mulch if washed away\n\n**PHOTO STOP #4:** Completed erosion control measures (silt fence, inlet protection, stabilized entrance)\n\n### Step 5: Ongoing Monitoring & Maintenance\n\n**Weekly Inspection Checklist:**\n- [ ] Silt fence intact (no tears, detachments, or sediment buildup)\n- [ ] Inlet protection clean and functional\n- [ ] Construction entrance stable (no mud tracking)\n- [ ] No off-site sediment discharge visible\n- [ ] Stockpiles covered or seeded if inactive >30 days\n- [ ] Graded areas stabilized (seeded, mulched, or actively worked)\n\n**After Rain Events:**\n- Inspect within 24 hours\n- Repair any washouts or failures immediately\n- Document with photos (required for permit compliance)\n\n**Removal:**\n- Only after site fully stabilized (grass established)\n- Remove silt fence carefully (accumulated sediment stays on-site)\n- Dispose of sediment and materials properly"

Setback Compliance:**\n- Measures from property corners to foundation layout\n- Compares to approved site plan\n- Non-compliance = stop work until corrected\n- May require surveyor verification if close to minimums\n\n**2. Foundation Dimensions:**\n- Spot-checks wall lengths against approved plans\n- Verifies squareness (may check diagonals)\n- Large discrepancies = rejection, re-layout required\n\n**3. Elevation Control:**\n- Checks that footing depth meets frost protection (6 feet in NB Zone 6)\n- Verifies finished floor elevation matches plans (flood risk areas)\n- May require surveyor certification of elevations\n\n**4. Bearing Surface:**\n- Visual inspection of excavation bottom (firm, undisturbed soil)\n- If questionable, may require geotechnical engineer verification\n- Organic soils, fill, or groundwater = rejection until addressed\n\n**Common Reasons for Rejection:**\n- Setback violation (must re-position foundation)\n- Insufficient frost protection (must excavate deeper)\n- Soft or unsuitable bearing soil (must remove and replace)\n- Layout doesn't match approved plans (must correct)\n- No surveyor certification (if required by municipality)\n\n### Municipal Inspector - Grading & Drainage Inspection\n\nThis inspection occurs at project completion, before occupancy permit issued.\n\n**Inspector Will Verify:**\n\n**1. Final Grades:**\n- Slope away from foundation (5% minimum for 10 feet)\n- No ponding or standing water near foundation\n- Finished grade below top of foundation (6\" minimum)\n- Lot drainage to street or approved discharge point\n\n**2. Erosion Control:**\n- Lot stabilized (grass, landscaping, or erosion control)\n- Silt fence removed (or explain why still needed)\n- No sediment on street or neighboring properties\n- Storm drains clear and functional\n\n**3. Driveway & Walkways:**\n- Positive drainage (no water pooling)\n- Proper connection to street (culvert if required)\n- Slopes not exceeding maximums (typically 10-12%)\n\n**Common Reasons for Rejection:**\n- Inadequate slope at foundation (water will pool)\n- Ponding on lot (drainage not established)\n- Site not stabilized (erosion risk)\n- Sediment discharge to street or storm system\n\n### Environmental Inspector - Erosion Control Inspection\n\nRandom inspections can occur anytime during construction.\n\n**Inspector Will Check:**\n\n**1. Silt Fence Condition:**\n- Properly installed (trenched, stakes upslope)\n- No gaps, tears, or detachments\n- Not overloaded with sediment (>1/3 height = non-compliant)\n- Located to intercept runoff\n\n**2. Sediment Discharge:**\n- No visible sediment leaving site\n- Storm drains protected\n- Street clean (no mud tracking)\n\n**3. Site Stabilization:**\n- Inactive areas stabilized (>30 days)\n- Stockpiles covered or seeded\n- Construction entrance functional\n\n**Violations Result In:**\n- **Minor:** Order to comply (fix within 24-48 hours)\n- **Moderate:** $1,000-$5,000 fine + order to comply\n- **Serious:** $5,000-$50,000 fine + stop work order + remediation\n- Sediment discharge to watercourse = criminal charges possible\n\n## Common Layout Defects & How to Avoid Them\n\n| Defect | Cause | Consequence | Prevention |\n|--------|-------|-------------|------------|\n| **Setback Violation** | Incorrect measurement from property line | Stop work, re-position foundation ($10,000-$50,000) | Verify property corners with surveyor, measure twice |\n| **Out of Square Foundation** | Poor 3-4-5 method, unequal diagonals | Every wall, floor, roof affected (crooked house) | Check diagonals, use large triangles (30-40-50) |\n| **Wrong Elevation** | Incorrect benchmark, math error | Drainage problems, flooding, code violation | Verify benchmark, double-check calculations |\n| **Over-Excavation** | Poor communication with excavator | Expensive fill and compaction, delays | Set clear grade stakes, monitor during excavation |\n| **Under-Excavation** | Insufficient frost depth | Foundation heave, cracking, structural damage | Verify excavation depth before footing pour |\n| **Poor Drainage** | Inadequate slope, low spots | Water infiltration, flooding, mold | Set proper grade stakes, verify slopes with transit |\n| **Erosion Control Failure** | Poor installation, no maintenance | Fines, sediment damage, stop work order | Proper installation, weekly inspections |\n| **Utility Strike** | No locate or ignoring marks | Service disruption, injury/death, massive fines | Call Before You Dig, respect locate marks |\n| **Soft Bearing Soil** | Not checking excavation bottom | Foundation settlement, cracking | Probe excavation, remove soft spots |\n| **Lost Layout** | String lines removed, stakes disturbed | Re-layout required (time and cost) | Protect batter boards, re-establish from reference points |\n\n## Red Flags (Stop Work and Correct Immediately)\n\n**During Layout:**\n- Setback less than required minimum (re-position immediately)\n- Diagonals differ by more than 1/2\" (foundation out of square)\n- Can't locate property corners (hire surveyor before proceeding)\n- Utility locate expired (>30 days old) - renew before excavation\n- Benchmark disturbed or lost (re-establish before continuing)\n\n**During Excavation:**\n- Soft or organic soil in excavation bottom (remove before proceeding)\n- Groundwater in excavation (dewater before footing pour)\n- Over-excavation beyond footing depth (fill and compact before forms)\n- Utility line exposed (support, protect, and notify utility company)\n- Erosion control failure (sediment leaving site) - stop work, repair immediately\n\n**During Grading:**\n- Ponding within 10 feet of foundation (re-grade to positive drainage)\n- Finished grade above top of foundation (creates rot/moisture risk)\n- No slope away from building (water will accumulate at foundation)\n- Sediment discharge to street or storm drain (erosion control failure)\n\n## Quality Standards - Acceptable Tolerances\n\n### Layout Accuracy:\n- **Foundation dimensions:** ±1/4\" on critical dimensions, ±1/2\" on overall length\n- **Squareness (diagonals):** Equal within ±1/4\"\n- **Setbacks:** Must meet or exceed minimums (no tolerance on underside)\n- **String line sag:** Maximum 1/4\" over 50 feet\n\n### Elevation Control:\n- **Benchmark readings:** Verify within ±1/8\" on repeated measurements\n- **Footing elevation:** ±1\" (footings can be screeded level)\n- **Finished floor elevation:** ±1/2\" (critical for drainage compliance)\n- **Grade stakes:** ±1/2\" acceptable for rough grading\n\n### Grading:\n- **Slope at foundation:** 5-10% (6-12\" drop over 10 feet)\n- **Overall lot grading:** ±6\" from plan elevations acceptable\n- **No ponding:** Water must drain within 24 hours of rainfall\n\n### Excavation:\n- **Footing depth:** +1\" / -0\" (can be slightly deeper, not shallower)\n- **Excavation width:** +6\" beyond required (provides working room)\n- **Bearing surface:** Firm (can't be depressed by foot pressure)\n\n## Documentation Best Practices\n\n**Photos to Take:**\n1. Property corners with survey stakes or pins\n2. Benchmark location and elevation marking\n3. Batter boards and string lines installed\n4. Excavation limits marked (before digging)\n5. Excavation complete (showing depth and bearing soil)\n6. Footing layout (before concrete)\n7. Erosion control installations\n8. Final grading complete\n\n**Records to Keep:**\n- Survey certificate or property description\n- Utility locate confirmation (valid dates)\n- Field notes (benchmark elevations, HI calculations)\n- Layout dimensions (measured vs. plan)\n- Inspection reports (building, erosion control)\n- Photos with dates (proves compliance)\n\n**Why Documentation Matters:**\n- Proves layout met code at time of construction\n- Protects against future boundary disputes\n- Required for insurance claims (if damage occurs)\n- Demonstrates professional practices to clients\n- Defense against lawsuits (shows due diligence)"

Measure 30 feet along first wall line from Corner A → Mark Point 1\n2. Estimate 90° angle and measure 40 feet from Corner A → Mark Point 2 (approximate)\n3. Measure diagonal from Point 1 to Point 2\n4. Adjust Point 2 until diagonal = exactly 50 feet\n5. Line from Corner A through Point 2 is exactly 90° to first wall\n\n## APPENDIX C: COMMON NB SETBACK REQUIREMENTS\n\n*Note: These are typical - ALWAYS verify with your specific municipality*\n\n### Moncton Zoning Bylaw (Example):\n\n**R1 (Single-Family Residential) Zone:**\n- Front yard: 25 feet (7.5 m)\n- Rear yard: 25 feet (7.5 m)\n- Side yard (one side): 10 feet (3.0 m)\n- Side yard (other side): 6 feet (1.8 m)\n- Combined side yards: 16 feet (4.8 m) minimum\n- Lot coverage: 35% maximum\n\n**R2 (Medium Density Residential) Zone:**\n- Front yard: 20 feet (6.0 m)\n- Rear yard: 20 feet (6.0 m)\n- Side yards: 6 feet (1.8 m) each\n- Lot coverage: 40% maximum\n\n### Dieppe Zoning Requirements (Example):\n\n**RU (Urban Residential) Zone:**\n- Front yard: 20 feet (6.0 m)\n- Rear yard: 20 feet (6.0 m)\n- Side yards: 5 feet (1.5 m) each minimum\n- Corner lot: 10 feet (3.0 m) on street side\n- Lot coverage: 45% maximum\n\n### Fredericton Zoning (Example):\n\n**R1 (Low Density Residential) Zone:**\n- Front yard: 25 feet (7.5 m)\n- Rear yard: 30 feet (9.0 m)\n- Side yard: 8 feet (2.4 m) minimum one side\n- Side yard: 4 feet (1.2 m) minimum other side\n- Lot coverage: 30% maximum\n\n### Special Setback Considerations:\n\n**Waterfront Properties:**\n- Often require 100+ feet setback from high water mark\n- Wetland buffer zones (15-30 m typical)\n- Flood plain restrictions\n\n**Corner Lots:**\n- Two \"front yards\" (one for each street)\n- Larger setbacks apply to maintain sight lines\n- Check both municipal and provincial requirements (DOT)\n\n**Steep Slopes:**\n- May require increased setbacks from slope crest\n- Geotechnical report often required (slopes >15%)\n- Setback typically 1.5x slope height\n\n## APPENDIX D: BUILDER'S TRANSIT SETUP GUIDE\n\n### Quick Setup Procedure:\n\n**1. Position Tripod:**\n- Spread legs to stable width\n- Adjust leg lengths until head is approximately level (within 6\")\n- Push legs firmly into ground\n- Head should be at comfortable viewing height (chest to eye level)\n\n**2. Mount Instrument:**\n- Place transit on tripod head\n- Secure with center screw (hand-tight, don't over-tighten)\n- Instrument should sit flat on mounting plate\n\n**3. Level Instrument:**\n- Rotate instrument until bubble vial is parallel to two leveling screws\n- Adjust those two screws (turn both simultaneously, opposite directions)\n- Bubble moves toward the screw you turn clockwise (right)\n- Center bubble between marks\n- Rotate instrument 90° (bubble now perpendicular to first position)\n- Adjust third screw to center bubble\n- Rotate back to first position and verify still level\n- Repeat until bubble stays centered in all positions\n\n**4. Focus Eyepiece:**\n- Point at sky or blank surface\n- Adjust eyepiece focus until crosshairs are sharp and black\n- Your eye should be relaxed (not straining)\n- This is set once per user (doesn't change during use)\n\n**5. Focus Objective:**\n- Point at grade rod\n- Adjust objective focus (large knob) until rod numbers are sharp\n- Check for parallax: Move your eye left/right while looking through eyepiece\n- If crosshairs appear to move on rod, not focused correctly\n- Re-focus until crosshairs stay on same rod reading when eye moves\n\n**6. Verify Setup:**\n- Rotate 360° while watching bubble (should stay centered)\n- Take backsight on known benchmark (verify elevation calculation)\n- If elevation doesn't match, re-check setup and readings\n\n### Troubleshooting Common Issues:\n\n**Bubble Won't Center:**\n- Tripod not stable (leg on soft ground or rock)\n- Move tripod to firmer location\n\n**Bubble Centered But Readings Wrong:**\n- Instrument out of calibration (needs professional service)\n- Rod being held crooked (use rod level)\n- Reading wrong section of rod (10.5 vs. 1.05)\n\n**Can't See Rod Clearly:**\n- Eyepiece not focused for your eye (adjust eyepiece first)\n- Objective not focused on rod distance (adjust objective)\n- Bright sun reflecting off rod (shade rod or reposition)\n\n**Crosshairs Move on Rod (Parallax):**\n- Objective not properly focused\n- Re-focus until crosshairs appear stationary on rod\n\n## APPENDIX E: LASER LEVEL SETUP GUIDE\n\n### Rotary Laser Quick Setup:\n\n**1. Position Tripod or Receiver:**\n- Set tripod on firm, level ground\n- Extend to comfortable working height\n- Or mount laser on grade rod for manual leveling\n\n**2. Mount Laser:**\n- Attach laser to tripod head or rod bracket\n- Ensure secure (laser will rotate)\n\n**3. Power On:**\n- Turn on laser\n- Self-leveling will activate (15-30 seconds)\n- Status light: Green = level, Red = out of range (not level)\n- If red light, reposition tripod more level (laser has limited leveling range ±5°)\n\n**4. Set Rotation Speed:**\n- Slow (300 RPM): More accurate, easier to see indoors\n- Fast (600 RPM): Easier to catch with detector outdoors\n- Match speed to application\n\n**5. Verify Level:**\n- Take reading at benchmark (backsight)\n- Move detector to second known point\n- Calculate elevation (should match known)\n- If off, check laser is fully leveled (green status light)\n\n### Using Laser Detector:\n\n**1. Mount on Grade Rod:**\n- Attach detector to rod with bracket\n- Detector window faces laser\n- Rod held plumb (use bubble level on rod)\n\n**2. Find Laser Beam:**\n- Move detector up/down on rod\n- Listen for beeping (faster = closer to on-grade)\n- Three beep patterns:\n  - **Fast beeps** = Detector above laser beam (move down)\n  - **Slow beeps** = Detector below laser beam (move up)\n  - **Solid tone** = On grade (read rod at center of detector)\n\n**3. Read Elevation:**\n- When detector beeps solid tone, mark or read rod\n- Read to bottom of detector window (marked on detector)\n- Calculate elevation: Ground = HI - Reading\n\n### Laser Safety:\n\n- Never look directly into laser beam (eye damage)\n- Class 2 lasers (most rotary lasers) safe for momentary exposure\n- Class 3 lasers (long-range) require laser safety glasses\n- Post warning signs if laser operating in public area\n- Keep laser away from airports (aircraft safety)\n\n## APPENDIX F: COMMON LAYOUT ABBREVIATIONS\n\n**Survey & Layout Terms:**\n- **BM** = Benchmark\n- **HI** = Height of Instrument\n- **BS** = Backsight (reading on known elevation)\n- **FS** = Foresight (reading on unknown elevation)\n- **TP** = Turning Point (temporary benchmark)\n- **FFE** = Finished Floor Elevation\n- **TOF** = Top of Foundation\n- **TOS** = Top of Slab\n- **FG** = Finished Grade\n- **C** = Cut (excavation required)\n- **F** = Fill (soil addition required)\n- **EX** = Existing (current condition)\n- **PROP** = Proposed (future condition)\n\n**Property Terms:**\n- **POB** = Point of Beginning (survey start point)\n- **ROW** = Right of Way\n- **ESM** = Easement\n- **SBL** = Setback Line\n- **PL** = Property Line\n\n**Measurement Abbreviations:**\n- **±** = Plus or minus (tolerance)\n- **'** = Feet\n- **\"** = Inches\n- **m** = Meters\n- **mm** = Millimeters\n- **%** = Percent (slope)\n- **Δ** = Delta (change in elevation)\n\n## APPENDIX G: USEFUL FORMULAS\n\n### Diagonal Calculation (Pythagorean Theorem):\n```\nDiagonal = √(Width² + Length²)\n```\n\n### Slope Percentage:\n```\nSlope % = (Vertical Rise / Horizontal Run) × 100\n```\n\n### Slope in Ratio (e.g., 1:10):\n```\nRatio = Horizontal Run / Vertical Rise\n```\n\n### Cut/Fill Calculation:\n```\nCut = Existing Grade - Desired Grade (positive = cut)\nFill = Desired Grade - Existing Grade (positive = fill)\n```\n\n### Height of Instrument:\n```\nHI = Benchmark Elevation + Backsight Reading\n```\n\n### Unknown Elevation:\n```\nElevation = HI - Foresight Reading\n```\n\n### Area of Rectangle:\n```\nArea = Length × Width\n```\n\n### Volume of Excavation (Rectangular):\n```\nVolume (cubic meters) = Length × Width × Depth\nVolume (cubic yards) = (Length × Width × Depth) / 27\n```\n\n## APPENDIX H: NB CONTACT INFORMATION\n\n### Utility Locates:\n- **NB One Call:** 1-800-222-4420\n- **Website:** nb1call.com\n- **Hours:** 24/7 (3 business days notice required)\n\n### Municipal Building Departments:\n\n**Moncton:**\n- Planning & Development: (506) 877-7707\n- Building Inspection: (506) 877-7676\n\n**Dieppe:**\n- Building Permits: (506) 877-7900\n\n**Fredericton:**\n- Development Services: (506) 460-2020\n\n**Saint John:**\n- Building Inspections: (506) 658-2976\n\n### Professional Associations:\n\n**Association of New Brunswick Land Surveyors (ANBLS):**\n- Phone: (506) 458-8263\n- Website: anbls.nb.ca\n- Find licensed surveyors\n\n**Engineers & Geoscientists New Brunswick (EGNB):**\n- Phone: (506) 458-8083\n- Website: egnb.ca\n- Find licensed engineers (geotechnical, structural)\n\n### Environmental:\n\n**NB Department of Environment:**\n- Erosion control inquiries: (506) 453-2690\n- Environmental violations: 1-800-565-1633"

        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) C 2-4 (Cut 2 feet 4 inches)", "B) F 2-4 (Fill 2 feet 4 inches)", "C) C 2-3 (Cut 2 feet 3 inches)", "D) F 2-3 (Fill 2 feet 3 inches)"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since desired grade (97.50) is HIGHER than current ground (95.20), fill is required. Fill amount = 97.50 - 95.20 = 2.30 feet = 2 feet 4 inches (approximately). Mark as 'F 2-4' meaning Fill 2 feet 4 inches."
