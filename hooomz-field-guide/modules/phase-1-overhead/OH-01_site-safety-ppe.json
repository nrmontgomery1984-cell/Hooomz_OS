      "content_md": "## What is Site Safety & Setup?\n\nSite safety and setup is the foundation of every successful construction project. It encompasses all activities required to prepare a work site before any construction work begins, maintain safe conditions throughout the project, and protect both workers and clients' property from harm.\n\nFor interior renovations, this means transforming an occupied or semi-occupied home into a controlled work environment where professional construction can take place safely and efficiently.\n\n## Why Does It Matter?\n\n### Legal & Financial Protection:\n- WorkSafeBC compliance prevents fines ($1,000-$50,000 per violation)\n- Proper safety documentation protects your company in case of incidents\n- Insurance claims require proof of safety protocols\n- Client lawsuits can be avoided with proper protection measures\n\n### Professional Reputation:\n- First impression sets tone for entire project\n- Clean, organized sites = professional contractor\n- Damage to client property = lost referrals and online reviews\n- Safety incidents = project delays and cost overruns\n\n### Worker Safety:\n- Construction has one of the highest injury rates of any industry\n- Preventable injuries cost time, money, and quality of life\n- Proper setup prevents 80% of jobsite accidents\n- Culture of safety starts with the first day on site\n\n## Certification Requirements\n\nTo receive Hooomz Apprentice Certification in Site Safety & Setup, you must:\n\n1. Complete this entire field guide\n2. Pass the review questions with 80% or higher (12/15 correct)\n3. Complete a practical setup assessment with a journeyman supervisor\n4. Demonstrate proper use of all PPE listed in Section 2\n\n> **This certification is REQUIRED before beginning any other Hooomz Buildz training guides.**\n\n## Safety Overview - The Hierarchy of Hazard Control\n\n(Most to least effective):\n\n1. **Elimination** - Remove the hazard entirely\n2. **Substitution** - Replace with something safer\n3. **Engineering Controls** - Isolate people from hazard\n4. **Administrative Controls** - Change how people work\n5. **PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)** - Protect the worker\n\nAlways use the highest level of control available."

Head Protection\n- **Hard Hat (CSA Type 1):** Required when overhead hazards exist\n- Examples: Working below other trades, demolition, material storage overhead\n- Not typically required for single-story interior renos with no overhead work\n\n### 7. Additional Protective Clothing\n- **Knee Pads:** Mandatory for tile work, flooring, low work\n- **Dust Suit:** For heavy dust work (drywall sanding, demo)\n- **High-Visibility Vest:** When working near traffic or loading/unloading\n\n## Essential Tools & Equipment for Site Setup\n\n### Protection & Containment:\n\n| Item | Purpose | Quantity (Typical Reno) |\n|------|---------|-------------------------|\n| Ram Board | Floor protection (heavy traffic) | 1 roll per 500 sq ft |\n| Red Rosin Paper | Floor protection (light traffic) | 1 roll per 1000 sq ft |\n| Painter's Plastic (6 mil) | Furniture/surface protection | 2-3 rolls |\n| Poly Sheeting (6 mil) | Dust barriers, vapor barrier | 2-4 rolls |\n| Painter's Tape (2\") | Plastic attachment, masking | 4-6 rolls |\n| Tuck Tape (2\") | Poly sealing, heavy-duty attachment | 2-3 rolls |\n| Zip Wall System | Dust barrier poles & zippers | 1 kit (10 poles) |\n| Door Zipper | Temporary access through barriers | 2-4 per project |\n\n### Site Organization:\n\n| Item | Purpose | Notes |\n|------|---------|-------|\n| Waste Bins | Material separation | 1 for garbage, 1 for recycling, 1 for demo |\n| Material Storage Shelving | Organize materials | Keeps site clean, prevents damage |\n| Tool Chest/Gang Box | Secure tool storage | Lock overnight, theft prevention |\n| Extension Cords (12-gauge) | Power distribution | 2-3 per work area |\n| Work Lights (LED) | Adequate illumination | 1 per 200 sq ft work area |\n| Shop Vacuum (HEPA filter) | Dust control | 1 per work crew |\n\n### First Aid & Emergency:\n\n| Item | Purpose | Location |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| First Aid Kit (Level 2) | Minor injuries | Accessible to all workers |\n| Fire Extinguisher (5 lb ABC) | Fire suppression | Near exit, unobstructed |\n| Eyewash Station (portable) | Chemical exposure | For painting/chemical work |\n| Emergency Contact List | Posted at site entrance | Client, supervisor, emergency services |\n\n## Building Science Principles for Interior Reno Setup\n\n### Dust Control & Indoor Air Quality\n\n**Why it matters:** Renovation dust contains:\n- Silica (from drywall, concrete, tile) - causes lung disease\n- Wood dust - respiratory irritant, potential carcinogen\n- Lead (in homes built pre-1978) - neurotoxin\n- Mold spores - respiratory issues, allergies\n\n### Containment Strategy:\n\n**Negative Pressure** - Work area should be at lower pressure than rest of home:\n- Use box fan facing OUT of work area window\n- Seal all doorways with poly and zip doors\n- Air flows INTO work area, preventing dust escape\n\n**HEPA Filtration** - Remove airborne particles:\n- Shop vac with HEPA filter for cleanup\n- Air scrubber with HEPA filter for continuous operation\n- Change filters regularly (clogged = ineffective)\n\n**Source Control** - Generate less dust:\n- Wet-cut tile and concrete when possible\n- Use dust shrouds on grinders and saws\n- Clean as you go rather than letting dust accumulate\n\n### Moisture Management\n\nOccupied Homes Create Moisture:\n- Cooking, showering, breathing = 10-15 liters water/day\n- Open walls/ceilings allow moisture into building cavities\n- Winter construction = condensation risk\n- Summer construction = humidity issues\n\n**Prevention Strategy:**\n- Maintain Poly Barriers - Keep conditioned air out of wall cavities\n- Ventilate Work Area - Crack a window even in winter\n- Don't Wet Materials - Store drywall, insulation, lumber dry\n- Dehumidifier - Use in basements and humid conditions\n- Heat Carefully - Propane heaters produce 1L water per hour of operation\n\n### Load Path & Structural Safety\n\n**Never assume a wall is non-structural:**\n- Load-bearing walls carry roof/floor weight to foundation\n- Bearing walls typically run perpendicular to joists\n- Check for doubled top plates - often indicates bearing\n- Always consult drawings or engineer before removing ANY wall\n\n**Temporary Support:**\n- If opening a bearing wall, temporary support wall required FIRST\n- Posts must be within 12\" of bearing wall\n- Support must extend 4' beyond opening on each side\n- Never partially demo a bearing wall without support in place\n\n## Code Considerations\n\n### WorkSafeBC Requirements:\n\n**Fall Protection (Part 11):**\n- Guardrails required at 10' (3m) height or greater\n- Scaffold must meet CSA standards\n- Ladder use: 1:4 ratio (1' out for every 4' up)\n\n**Confined Spaces (Part 9):**\n- Attics, crawl spaces, mechanical rooms may qualify\n- Requires atmospheric testing and monitoring\n- Emergency rescue plan required\n\n**Hazardous Materials (Part 6):**\n- Asbestos surveys required for pre-1990 homes\n- Lead awareness for pre-1978 homes\n- Mold remediation requires protocol\n\n**Noise Exposure (Part 7):**\n- Limit: 85 dBA for 8-hour exposure\n- Most power tools exceed this (circular saw = 110 dBA)\n- Hearing protection mandatory\n\n**Electrical Safety (Part 19):**\n- CSA-approved extension cords only\n- GFCI protection required for all temporary power\n- Damaged cords = immediately tag out\n\n### Building Code (NBC 2020)\n\n**Interior Renovation Permits Required For:**\n- Structural alterations (removing walls, beams)\n- Plumbing/gas/electrical work (licensed trades)\n- Adding/relocating bathrooms or kitchens\n- Basement development (new living space)\n- Window/door changes in fire-rated walls\n\n**Permits NOT Required For (typically):**\n- Painting, flooring, trim work\n- Cabinet installation (non-structural)\n- Tile work (non-structural)\n- Drywall repair/replacement (non-structural)\n\n> **Note:** Check with local building department - requirements vary by municipality"

      "content_md": "## PRE-WORK CHECKLIST (Before Arriving at Site)\n\n### 24-48 Hours Before Start:\n- [ ] Client walkthrough completed and documented (photos/video)\n- [ ] Scope of work confirmed in writing\n- [ ] Access instructions confirmed (key location, lockbox code, contact)\n- [ ] Parking plan established (street parking, driveway, neighbor's space)\n- [ ] Material delivery scheduled and confirmed\n- [ ] Waste bin delivery scheduled (if required)\n- [ ] All permits obtained and posted\n- [ ] Crew assigned and notified of start time/location\n\n### Morning of First Day:\n- [ ] All PPE packed and inspected (replace worn items)\n- [ ] First aid kit stocked and current (check expiry dates)\n- [ ] Fire extinguisher inspected and charged\n- [ ] Tools inventoried and ready (see Section 2 list)\n- [ ] Protection materials loaded (ram board, poly, tape)\n- [ ] Client contacted with ETA (30 minutes before arrival)\n\n## ARRIVAL & INITIAL SETUP (Day 1: 0-2 Hours)\n\n### Step 1: Site Entry & Introduction (15 minutes)\n\n**Park Respectfully:**\n- Block driveways only if client approved\n- Don't block mailboxes, fire hydrants, neighbor driveways\n- Use cones/signs if parking on street with trailer\n\n**Meet the Client (if occupied):**\n- Introduce entire crew by name\n- Exchange phone numbers (crew lead - homeowner)\n- Confirm work hours and break times\n- Ask about pets, children, special needs\n- Review bathroom/kitchen use policy\n- Confirm daily cleanup expectations\n\n**Document Pre-Existing Conditions:**\n- Photo/video walkthrough of entire home (not just work area)\n- Capture: Floors, walls, furniture, landscaping, driveway\n- Focus on: Pre-existing damage, high-value items, tight spaces\n- Store in project folder with date/time stamp\n\n> **This protects you from false damage claims**\n\n### Step 2: Establish Work Zone Boundaries (30 minutes)\n\n**Define the \"Hot Zone\" (active construction area):**\n- Identify all rooms involved in work\n- Map access routes from entry door to work area\n- Determine material staging location\n- Plan waste removal route\n\n**Create Access Path:**\n- This is the route from front door to work area\n- Will be protected but accessible\n- Should avoid high-traffic family areas if possible\n- Consider stairs, tight corners, door widths\n\n**Mark Boundaries:**\n- Use painter's tape on floor to mark protection zones\n- Post signs: \"CONSTRUCTION AREA - PPE REQUIRED\"\n- Identify \"clean zones\" where no dusty boots allowed\n\n### Step 3: Floor Protection Installation (45 minutes)\n\n**Protection Level by Traffic & Use:**\n\n| Area | Traffic Level | Protection Type | Installation |\n|------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| Work Zone | Heavy (tools, materials) | Ram Board | Tape seams, tape to baseboards |\n| Access Path | Medium (walking only) | Ram Board or Red Rosin | Overlap 6\", tape seams |\n| Adjacent Rooms | Light (occasional) | Red Rosin Paper | Tape to doorways |\n| Stairs | High (slippery when dusty) | Ram Board + Anti-Slip | Tape every tread, wrap nosing |\n\n**Installation Procedure:**\n\n1. **Clean floors first** - Sweep, vacuum, remove debris\n   - Dirt under protection = scratches when walked on\n\n2. **Roll out protection** - Work from farthest point toward entry\n   - Ram Board: Printed side UP (logo visible)\n   - Red Rosin: Slick side DOWN (felt side up)\n\n3. **Overlap seams** - Minimum 6\" overlap\n   - Tape every seam with painter's tape or tuck tape\n   - No gaps = no dust penetration\n\n4. **Seal perimeter** - Tape to baseboards/walls\n   - Painter's tape on finished surfaces (easy removal)\n   - Tuck tape on rough surfaces (better hold)\n\n5. **Reinforce high-traffic areas** - Double layer at:\n   - Doorways (most scuffing occurs here)\n   - Base of stairs\n   - Material staging areas\n\n**PHOTO STOP #1:** Installed floor protection with visible seams and perimeter taping\n\n### Step 4: Dust Barrier Installation (60 minutes)\n\n**Zip Wall System (Professional Method):**\n\n**Materials Needed:**\n- Zip Wall poles (spring-loaded, telescoping)\n- 6 mil poly sheeting\n- Painter's tape (for poly attachment)\n- Door zipper (for access points)\n- Utility knife\n\n**Installation Steps:**\n\n1. **Measure doorway/opening** - Floor to ceiling height\n   - Cut poly 12\" wider and 6\" taller than opening\n   - Extra material allows for proper sealing\n\n2. **Install top of poly first:**\n   - Tape poly to ceiling/header with painter's tape\n   - Overlap tape by 50% for secure hold\n   - Smooth out wrinkles as you go\n\n3. **Install Zip Wall poles:**\n   - Place poles 4-6' apart along poly edge\n   - Extend pole to just below ceiling height\n   - Clamp poly edge into pole track\n   - Compress spring to wedge pole between floor/ceiling\n   - Never exceed ceiling height - can damage drywall\n\n4. **Seal sides and bottom:**\n   - Tape poly to walls on both sides\n   - Tape poly to floor protection (not directly to finished floor)\n   - Seal any gaps where dust could escape\n\n5. **Install door zipper (for access):**\n   - Position zipper in center of poly sheet\n   - Peel backing and press onto poly\n   - Use razor blade to cut poly along zipper path\n   - Test zipper operation before proceeding\n\n**Negative Pressure Verification:**\n- Place box fan in window facing OUT\n- Tape around fan to seal gaps\n- Hold tissue paper near zipper door - should pull slightly inward\n- If poly \"breathes\" outward, increase exhaust fan speed\n\n**PHOTO STOP #2:** Completed dust barrier with door zipper and negative pressure fan\n\n### Step 5: Material Staging & Organization (30 minutes)\n\n**Material Storage Zones:**\n\n**Zone 1: Active Materials (in work area)**\n- Today's materials only\n- Drywall sheets (stand on edge, lean against wall)\n- Trim pieces (horizontal on sawhorses)\n- Bags of compound (off floor, on scrap wood)\n- Rule: If not using today, not in work zone\n\n**Zone 2: Project Materials (secure, dry location)**\n- Garage, basement, or dedicated room\n- Stack properly to prevent damage:\n  - Drywall: On edge, max 6 sheets per stack\n  - Lumber: Flat, supported every 4', covered\n  - Tile: Boxes stacked max 6 high, no overhang\n  - Flooring: Acclimatize per manufacturer (48-72 hours)\n- Create aisle for access\n\n**Zone 3: Tools (secured overnight)**\n- Locking gang box OR\n- Locked room in home (client permission) OR\n- Load into vehicle and take home\n- Never leave tools unsecured - theft is common\n\n**Waste Management:**\nSet up 3-bin system:\n1. **Garbage** - General waste, plastic, non-recyclables\n2. **Recycling** - Clean cardboard, metal scrap, clean wood\n3. **Demo Debris** - Drywall, plaster, demolition materials\n\nLabel each bin clearly with signs.\n\n**PHOTO STOP #3:** Organized material staging with labeled waste bins\n\n### Step 6: Power & Lighting Setup (20 minutes)\n\n**Extension Cord Selection:**\n- 12-gauge (20 amp) - For circular saws, miter saws, shop vac (under 50')\n- 10-gauge (30 amp) - For table saws, compressors, heaters (over 50')\n\n> **DO NOT use 14 or 16-gauge - fire hazard with power tools**\n\n**GFCI Protection:**\n- All temporary power must be GFCI protected\n- Use inline GFCI extension cord OR\n- Plug into GFCI outlet (bathroom, kitchen, exterior)\n- Test GFCI weekly (push test button, should trip)\n\n**Cord Management:**\n- Route cords along walls (not across walkways)\n- Tape down with duct tape where crossing is unavoidable\n- Coil excess cord neatly (don't leave loops)\n- Check daily for damage (cuts, exposed wire, bent prongs)\n- Damaged cord = immediate removal and replacement\n\n**Lighting:**\n- Work area should have 50 footcandles minimum (500 lux)\n- LED work lights: 1 per 200 sq ft\n- Position to eliminate shadows at work height\n- Plug lights into different circuits than power tools\n\n**Circuit Capacity Check:**\n- Identify which breakers serve work area\n- Note amperage (usually 15A or 20A)\n- Calculate tool load:\n  - Circular saw: 13A\n  - Shop vac: 10A\n  - Miter saw: 13A\n- Don't exceed 80% of breaker rating (12A on 15A circuit)\n- Distribute tools across multiple circuits\n\n**PHOTO STOP #4:** Power distribution with GFCI protection and properly routed cords\n\n### Step 7: Safety Stations & Signage (15 minutes)\n\n**First Aid Station:**\n- Mount Level 2 first aid kit on wall near entry\n- Height: 4-5' (accessible to all workers)\n- Post emergency contact list beside kit:\n  - 911\n  - Client phone number\n  - Supervisor phone number\n  - Site address (for calling 911)\n  - Nearest hospital with ER\n\n**Fire Extinguisher:**\n- Position near exit door\n- Unobstructed access (nothing stored within 3')\n- Mounted 4' off floor (top of extinguisher)\n- Inspect monthly:\n  - Pin and tamper seal intact\n  - Pressure gauge in green zone\n  - Hose and nozzle clear\n  - No visible damage\n\n**Required Signage:**\n- Work Area Entry: \"CONSTRUCTION ZONE - PPE REQUIRED\"\n- Dust Barrier Doors: \"KEEP CLOSED - DUST CONTAINMENT\"\n- Bathroom: \"CREW BATHROOM\" or \"OFF LIMITS\" (client preference)\n- Waste Bins: \"GARBAGE\" / \"RECYCLING\" / \"DEMO DEBRIS\"\n- Material Storage: \"DANGER - FALLING HAZARD\" (if stacked materials)\n\n**PHOTO STOP #5:** Completed safety setup with visible signage and emergency equipment\n\n## DAILY OPERATIONS (During Project)\n\n### Start of Each Day (15 minutes)\n\n**Crew Huddle (5 minutes):**\n- Review today's tasks and goals\n- Identify hazards specific to today's work\n- Assign roles (who's doing what)\n- Confirm material/tool availability\n- Take questions\n\n**Site Inspection Walk (10 minutes):**\n- Floor protection intact (no tears, no tape lifting)\n- Dust barriers sealed (no gaps, zipper functional)\n- Extension cords undamaged\n- GFCI protection functional (test button)\n- Fire extinguisher in place and charged\n- First aid kit accessible\n- Lighting adequate\n- Ventilation operating (negative pressure fan on)\n- No new hazards (client moved items, pet access, etc.)\n\nDocument any issues immediately and correct before starting work.\n\n### Mid-Day Check (Lunch Break)\n\n**Quick Reset (10 minutes):**\n- Sweep work area (don't let dust accumulate)\n- Organize tools (return to designated spots)\n- Remove full waste bags/bins\n- Refill water bottles (hydration = safety)\n- Restock consumables (blades, screws, tape, etc.)\n\n### End of Each Day (30-45 minutes)\n\n**This is NOT optional - it's part of the job.**\n\n**Cleanup Sequence:**\n\n1. **Rough Cleanup (15 minutes):**\n   - Collect all scrap and debris\n   - Sort into appropriate waste bins\n   - Vacuum work area with HEPA shop vac\n   - Wipe down dusty surfaces with damp cloth (don't dry-sweep drywall dust)\n\n2. **Tool Inventory (10 minutes):**\n   - Count tools against checklist\n   - Clean tools (sawdust = premature wear)\n   - Charge batteries overnight\n   -

FINAL CLEANUP & REMOVAL\n\n### Final Cleanup (2-4 hours, depending on project size)\n\nThis cleanup is different - it's about returning the home to the client, not just tidying up for tomorrow.\n\n**Deep Clean Sequence:**\n\n1. **Remove ALL Construction Materials (30 minutes):**\n   - Scrap wood, drywall, empty boxes\n   - Unused materials return to storage or vehicle\n   - All waste bins emptied and removed\n   - Tools and equipment loaded\n\n2. **HEPA Vacuum EVERYTHING (60 minutes):**\n   - Work area floors, walls, ceiling\n   - Adjacent rooms (dust travels)\n   - Window sills and ledges\n   - Light fixtures and ceiling fans\n   - Inside cabinets and closets (if opened during work)\n   - Use HEPA vacuum only - regular vacuum spreads dust\n\n3. **Damp Wipe All Surfaces (45 minutes):**\n   - Countertops, tables, shelves\n   - Door frames and doors\n   - Baseboards and trim (outside work area)\n   - Window sills\n   - Light switches and outlets\n   - Thermostat and smoke detectors\n   - Change wipe cloths frequently - don't smear dust around\n\n4. **Mop Hard Floors (30 minutes):**\n   - Work area first (most dust)\n   -

protection)\n\n### Violations Result In:\n- **Minor:** Written order to comply (no fine, but must correct immediately)\n- **Moderate:** $500-$5,000 fine + order to comply\n- **Serious:** $5,000-$50,000 fine + possible work stoppage\n- **Repeat Violations:** Increased fines + director/officer liability\n\n## Common Site Setup Defects\n\n| Defect | Risk | Prevention |\n|--------|------|------------|\n| Inadequate Floor Protection | Scratches, dents, stains on flooring | Use proper protection (ram board for heavy traffic) |\n| Gaps in Dust Barriers | Dust spreads to entire home, client complaints | Seal all edges, test with tissue paper |\n| No Negative Pressure | Dust escapes work area | Exhaust fan in window, verify with tissue test |\n| Overloaded Circuits | Breaker trips, work delays, fire risk | Calculate amperage, distribute loads |\n| Damaged Extension Cords | Shock hazard, fire risk, WorkSafeNB violation | Daily inspection, immediate replacement |\n| Poor Material Storage | Warped lumber, damaged drywall, waste | Stack properly, keep dry, support every 4' |\n| Inadequate Lighting | Quality issues (missed defects), safety hazards | 1 light per 200 sq ft, eliminate shadows |\n| No Daily Cleanup | Client dissatisfaction, dust contamination | 30-45 minutes end of each day |\n| Missing Safety Equipment | Worker injury, WorkSafeNB violations, liability | First aid kit, fire extinguisher, PPE compliance |\n\n## Red Flags (Stop Work and Correct Immediately)\n\n- Worker without safety glasses in work zone\n- Damaged extension cord in use\n- Overloaded circuit (repeated breaker trips)\n- Material stored unsafely (falling hazard)\n- Dust escaping work area (client visible)\n- Fire extinguisher missing or discharged\n- First aid kit empty or expired\n- Exit path blocked by materials"

        "type": "mcq",
        "choices": ["A) To cool down the work area", "B) To prevent dust from escaping to other parts of the home", "C) To increase air circulation", "D) To reduce heating costs"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Negative pressure (lower air pressure in the work area than the rest of the home) causes air to flow INTO the work area rather than OUT, preventing construction dust from escaping to clean areas of the home."
