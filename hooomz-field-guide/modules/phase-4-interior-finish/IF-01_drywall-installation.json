Plan sheet layout to minimize butt joints.\n\n### Code Requirements\n\n**Fire Separation:**\n- Attached garage: 5/8\" Type X on garage side\n- Furnace/utility rooms: Check local requirements\n- Ceiling below living space: Often 5/8\" Type X"

Hang ceilings first, then walls\n2. Run sheets perpendicular to framing\n3. Stagger joints between rows\n4. Avoid joints at corners of openings\n5. Minimize butt joints (end-to-end)\n\n**Joint Placement:**\n\n| Location | Preference |\n|----------|------------|\n| Over doors/windows | Avoid joints at corners |\n| Ceiling/wall junction | Ceiling sheet to wall, wall sheet butts to ceiling |\n| Butt joints | On framing, stagger from adjacent rows |\n| Inside corners | One sheet overlaps other |\n\n### Material Calculation\n\n**Basic Formula:**\n- Calculate wall/ceiling square footage\n- Divide by 32 (sq ft per 4x8 sheet)\n- Add 10% for waste and cuts\n\n**Example:**\n- Room: 12' x 14' with 8' ceilings\n- Walls: (12+12+14+14) x 8 = 416 sq ft\n- Ceiling: 12 x 14 = 168 sq ft\n- Total: 584 sq ft ÷ 32 = 18.25 sheets\n- With 10%: 20 sheets\n\n### Material Storage\n\n- Store flat on level surface\n- Support entire length (no sagging)\n- Keep dry and climate-controlled\n- Acclimate to room temperature before hanging"

      "content_md": "## Ceiling Installation\n\n### Why Ceilings First?\n\n- Wall sheets support ceiling edges\n- Cleaner corner joints\n- Easier to achieve tight fit\n- Standard professional practice\n\n### Tools for Ceiling Work\n\n**Essential:**\n- Drywall lift (highly recommended)\n- T-brace (deadman) for manual lifting\n- Screw gun with depth setting\n- Utility knife and T-square\n- Chalk line and tape measure\n\n### Using a Drywall Lift\n\n**Procedure:**\n1. Load sheet face-down on lift\n2. Position under ceiling location\n3. Crank to raise sheet\n4. Fine-tune position\n5. Drive fasteners\n6. Lower and move lift\n\n### Manual Installation (T-Brace)\n\n**Two-Person Method:**\n1. Measure and cut sheet\n2. Lift to ceiling with partner\n3. Wedge T-brace under sheet\n4. Adjust position\n5. Fasten while brace holds\n\n### Fastening Ceilings\n\n**Screw Pattern:**\n- Perimeter: 8\" on center\n- Field: 12\" on center\n- Start from center, work outward\n\n**Screw Depth:**\n- Just dimples paper\n- Doesn't break paper face\n- Head below surface\n\n### Common Ceiling Issues\n\n| Problem | Cause | Prevention |\n|---------|-------|------------|\n| Sagging | Screws too far apart | Follow fastening schedule |\n| Nail pops | Wood shrinkage | Use screws, not nails |\n| Cracks at edges | No floating | Float corners (screws 8\"+ from walls) |\n| Truss uplift cracks | Seasonal movement | Use floating corner detail |\n\n> **Floating Corners:** Keep screws 8\" from wall-ceiling intersection on ceiling, 12\" from ceiling on walls. This allows normal building movement without cracking."

      "content_md": "## Wall Installation\n\n### Horizontal vs. Vertical\n\n**Horizontal (Preferred):**\n- Fewer linear feet of joints\n- Stronger joint at 48\" height (hitting more studs)\n- Easier to finish mid-wall joint\n- Standard professional practice\n\n**Vertical:**\n- May be required by fire code\n- Used when ceiling height equals sheet length\n- Commercial applications\n\n### Installation Sequence\n\n**1. Top Sheet First**\n- Tight to ceiling\n- Level bottom edge\n- Drive screws starting at top\n\n**2. Bottom Sheet**\n- Tight to top sheet\n- Use lifter/wedge at bottom\n- Leave 1/2\" gap at floor\n\n### Fastening Walls\n\n**Screw Pattern:**\n- Perimeter: 8\" on center\n- Field: 16\" on center (12\" for ceilings)\n- Minimum 3/8\" from edges\n\n**Screw Selection:**\n\n| Drywall | Screw Length |\n|---------|-------------|\n| 1/2\" single layer | 1-1/4\" |\n| 5/8\" single layer | 1-5/8\" |\n| Double layer (base) | 1\" |\n| Double layer (face) | 1-5/8\" |\n\n### Cutting Techniques\n\n**Score and Snap:**\n1. Mark measurement on face\n2. Score paper with knife along straightedge\n3. Snap away from score\n4. Cut back paper\n5. Smooth edge if needed\n\n**For Outlets/Boxes:**\n1. Measure from edges to box\n2. Transfer to sheet\n3. Score outline\n4. Cut with drywall saw or router\n5. Test fit before fastening\n\n### Around Openings\n\n**Windows and Doors:**\n- No joints at corners of openings\n- L-shaped or notched pieces around corners\n- Factory edges toward opening\n\n**Electrical Boxes:**\n- Tight fit (no more than 1/8\" gap)\n- Required for fire blocking\n- Use adjustable boxes if needed"

Install base layer\n2. Offset face layer joints minimum 12\"\n3. Screws must penetrate framing 5/8\" minimum\n\n### Soffits and Bulkheads\n\n**Framing Check:**\n- Adequate backing at all corners\n- Blocking for drywall edges\n- Square and plumb construction\n\n**Installation Order:**\n1. Sides first\n2. Bottom last\n3. Use corner bead at all outside corners\n\n### Control Joints\n\n**When Required:**\n- Runs over 30 feet\n- Where walls change direction\n- Where dissimilar materials meet\n- At expansion joints in structure\n\n**Installation:**\n- Leave 1/4\" gap in drywall\n- Install control joint bead\n- Finish like corner bead\n\n### Cement Board Installation\n\n**For Tile Areas:**\n- 1/4\" for walls, 1/2\" for floors\n- Cement board screws required\n- 8\" OC field, 4\" OC edges\n- Tape joints with alkali-resistant tape\n- Waterproof membrane behind in wet areas\n\n> **Remember:** Cement board is NOT waterproof.
