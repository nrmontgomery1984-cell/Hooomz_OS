      "title": "Prehung Door Installation",
      "content": "## Installing Prehung Interior Doors\n\nPrehung doors come with the door already hung in the frame, making installation straightforward but requiring attention to plumb and level.\n\n### Components\n\n- Door slab (the door itself)\n- Jamb (frame around door)\n- Hinges (attached to jamb and slab)\n- Stop (molding that door closes against)\n- Threshold (not always included for interior)\n\n### Rough Opening Requirements\n\n**Standard Formula:**\n- Width: Door width + 2\" (for jamb + shimming)\n- Height: Door height + 2-1/2\" (for jamb + floor clearance)\n\n| Door Size | Rough Opening |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| 2'-6\" x 6'-8\" | 32\" x 82-1/2\" |\n| 2'-8\" x 6'-8\" | 34\" x 82-1/2\" |\n| 3'-0\" x 6'-8\" | 38\" x 82-1/2\" |\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n1. **Check rough opening** - Verify dimensions\n2. **Remove packaging** - Inspect for damage\n3. **Position door** - Set in opening\n4. **Check hinge side** - Plumb with level\n5. **Shim behind hinges** - At least 3 locations\n6. **Nail through shims** - Into jack studs\n7. **Check latch side** - Maintain even gap\n8. **Shim latch side** - Above/below strike\n9. **Verify operation** - Door should swing freely\n10. **Install casing** - Both sides\n\n### Critical Measurements\n\n| Location | Gap | Tolerance |\n|----------|-----|----------|\n| Top (head jamb) | 1/8\" | ± 1/16\" |\n| Sides (both) | 1/8\" | ± 1/16\" |\n| Bottom (floor) | 3/8\" - 3/4\" | Varies |\n\n> **Pro Tip:** Always check the door swing direction before installation. Stand on the side the door swings toward - hinges should be on the same side as the handle you reach for."

      "title": "Door Hardware Installation",
      "content": "## Installing Locksets & Hardware\n\nProper hardware installation ensures smooth operation and security. Most interior doors use passage or privacy locksets.\n\n### Lockset Types\n\n| Type | Function | Application |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| Passage | No lock | Hallways, closets |\n| Privacy | Push-button/turn lock | Bedrooms, bathrooms |\n| Keyed Entry | Key lock | Exterior doors, offices |\n| Dummy | Non-functional | Closet doors, decorative |\n\n### Standard Measurements\n\n**Backset Options:**\n- 2-3/8\" (standard residential)\n- 2-3/4\" (commercial/some modern)\n\n**Bore Hole Sizes:**\n- Main bore: 2-1/8\" diameter\n- Latch bore: 1\" diameter\n- Edge bore: 7/8\" x 1\" (latch face)\n\n### Lockset Installation\n\n1. **Mark height** - 36\" standard (34-38\" acceptable)\n2. **Position template** - From lockset package\n3. **Drill main bore** - From both sides to prevent tearout\n4. **Drill latch bore** - Edge of door to main bore\n5. **Mortise latch face** - Chisel flush with edge\n6. **Install latch** - Secure with screws\n7. **Install interior/exterior knobs** - Connect through door\n8. **Test operation** - Smooth turn and latch\n\n### Strike Plate Installation\n\n1. Close door against frame\n2. Mark latch position on jamb\n3. Drill mortise hole (depth = latch throw + 1/8\")\n4. Chisel strike plate mortise\n5. Install strike plate\n6. Test door closure\n\n### Hinge Adjustments\n\n| Problem | Solution |\n|---------|----------|\n| Door sags | Tighten top hinge, longer screws |\n| Door springs open | Hinge side too close, adjust shims |\n| Door won't latch | Strike too far, reposition |\n| Hinge binds | Deepen mortise, check for paint |\n\n> **Pro Tip:** When door hinges are loose, replace short screws with 3\" screws that reach into the stud behind the jamb for solid grip."

Adjust for smooth operation\n\n**Track Types:**\n- Top-hung (doors hang from track)\n- Bottom-roll (doors roll on floor track)\n\n### Pocket Doors\n\n**Applications:**\n- Space-saving installations\n- Bathrooms with tight clearance\n- Between rooms\n\n**Installation Considerations:**\n- Requires wall cavity depth\n- Split studs or pocket frame\n- Must be planned during framing\n- Hardware quality critical\n\n**Common Issues:**\n| Problem | Cause | Solution |\n|---------|-------|----------|\n| Sticking | Track debris | Clean track |\n| Won't stay closed | Latch misaligned | Adjust strike |\n| Difficult to open | Hardware worn | Replace rollers |\n| Rattles | Loose guides | Adjust guides |\n\n> **Pro Tip:** For new construction, specify pocket door frames early. Retrofitting pocket doors into existing walls is possible but requires extensive wall modification."

      "content": "## Finishing Doors & Common Problems\n\nProper finishing and maintenance keeps doors operating smoothly for years.\n\n### Painting Interior Doors\n\n**Preparation:**\n1. Remove door from hinges\n2. Remove hardware\n3. Clean and scuff sand\n4. Fill holes with wood filler\n5. Prime bare wood and filler\n\n**Painting Sequence:**\n1. Panel recesses first\n2. Panel faces\n3. Horizontal rails\n4. Vertical stiles\n5. Edges\n\n**Tips:**\n- Paint top and bottom edges to seal\n- Apply thin coats\n- Allow full dry between coats\n- Reinstall after 24+ hours\n\n### Common Problems & Solutions\n\n| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |\n|---------|--------------|----------|\n| Sticking at top | Door swelled | Plane or sand top edge |\n| Sticking at latch | Frame shifted | Adjust strike, deepen mortise |\n| Won't stay closed | Warped door | Replace door or adjust stops |\n| Squeaky hinges | Lack of lubrication | WD-40 or silicone spray |\n| Drafts around door | Worn weatherstrip | Replace weatherstripping |\n| Light gaps | Door/frame not square | Adjust stops |\n\n### Seasonal Movement\n\n**NB Zone 6 Considerations:**\n- Doors may swell in summer humidity\n- May shrink in winter (heating season)\n- Allow 1/8\" clearance on sides\n- Avoid tight fits\n\n### Hardware Maintenance\n\n| Component | Maintenance | Frequency |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| Hinges | Lubricate pins | Annually |\n| Locksets | Graphite in keyway | As needed |\n| Strike plates | Check screw tightness | Annually |\n| Door stops | Tighten or replace | As needed |\n\n> **Pro Tip:** If a door sticks seasonally, wait for the opposite season to make adjustments. A door that sticks in summer may gap in winter if planed down."
