Cut out rotted section completely\n2. Treat remaining wood with borate\n3. Sister full-length new member\n4. Seal cuts with preservative\n5. Address moisture source\n```\n\n**Extensive Rot:**\n```\n1. Shore floor above\n2. Remove damaged joist entirely\n3. Install new joist\n4. Match bearing conditions\n5. Connect to rim/header\n6.

        "answer": "The moisture source that caused the rot",
        "explanation": "Before or during rot repair, the moisture source must be identified and eliminated. Without addressing the cause, the new materials will also rot. This is especially critical in NB's wet climate."

        "answer": "Reinforcing a damaged beam with steel",
        "explanation": "A flitch plate repair involves sandwiching a steel plate between or alongside beam members and through-bolting them together. This significantly increases the beam's load-carrying capacity."

        "answer": "25% of stud depth",
        "explanation": "Notches in studs cannot exceed 25% of the stud depth. Deeper notches significantly weaken the stud and require reinforcement with steel plates or sistering."

        "answer": "Metal post base elevated from floor",
        "explanation": "Support posts should have metal post bases that elevate the wood above the concrete floor. This prevents moisture wicking into the post end and subsequent rot, which is common in NB's climate."
