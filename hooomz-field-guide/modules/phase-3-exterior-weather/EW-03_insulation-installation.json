Energy-efficient homes in NB typically exceed these values by 25-50%.\n\n## Types of Insulation\n\n### Batt Insulation\n- **Fiberglass batts** - Most common, R-3.2 to R-4.3 per inch\n- **Mineral wool batts** - R-4.0 per inch, fire resistant, moisture resistant\n- **Cotton/denim batts** - R-3.5 per inch, recycled content\n\n### Loose-Fill/Blown Insulation\n- **Cellulose** - R-3.7 per inch, recycled paper, treated for fire/pests\n- **Fiberglass** - R-2.5 to R-3.7 per inch, depending on density\n- **Mineral wool** - R-3.0 to R-3.3 per inch\n\n### Spray Foam Insulation\n- **Open-cell** - R-3.7 per inch, vapor permeable, requires vapor barrier\n- **Closed-cell** - R-6.0 to R-7.0 per inch, vapor barrier at 2\", structural strength\n\n### Rigid Board Insulation\n- **EPS (Expanded Polystyrene)** - R-4.0 per inch, moisture resistant\n- **XPS (Extruded Polystyrene)** - R-5.0 per inch, higher moisture resistance\n- **Polyisocyanurate (Polyiso)** - R-6.0 to R-6.5 per inch, foil-faced\n- **Mineral wool board** - R-4.0 per inch, fire resistant, vapor permeable"

      "content_md": "## Understanding R-Value\n\n**R-Value** measures thermal resistance—the ability to resist heat flow.\n\n### Nominal vs. Effective R-Value\n\n**Nominal R-Value:** The R-value of the insulation material itself\n- R-20 batt = R-20 nominal\n\n**Effective R-Value:** The actual R-value of the entire assembly\n- R-20 batt in 2x6 wall with 15% framing = R-15 effective\n- Why? Wood studs are only R-1.25 per inch\n\n### Thermal Bridging\n\nThermal bridges occur where framing creates paths for heat loss:\n\n| Framing Type | Framing Factor | R-Value Reduction |\n|--------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| 16\" OC studs | 25% | ~20-25% |\n| 24\" OC studs | 15% | ~15% |\n| Advanced framing | 10% | ~10% |\n\n**Solutions for Thermal Bridging:**\n- Continuous exterior insulation (best)\n- Advanced framing techniques\n- Insulated headers and corners\n- Thermal break materials\n\n## How Insulation Works with Air/Vapor Barriers\n\n### Critical Relationships\n\n**Air Barrier + Insulation:**\n- Insulation without air sealing loses 25-40% of effectiveness\n- Wind washing through insulation dramatically reduces R-value\n- Air barrier must be continuous and sealed\n\n**Vapor Barrier + Insulation:**\n- In Zone 6, vapor barrier goes on the WARM side (interior)\n- Vapor barrier prevents warm, moist interior air from reaching cold surfaces\n- At least 2/3 of total R-value should be on the cold side of vapor barrier\n\n### Exterior Insulation Rule for Zone 6\n\nTo prevent condensation:\n- **R-7.5 minimum** exterior insulation for 2x4 walls\n- **R-11.25 minimum** exterior insulation for 2x6 walls\n\nOr use the **ratio rule:**\n- At least 35% of total R-value should be outboard of structural sheathing\n\n## Material Properties Comparison\n\n| Insulation Type | R/inch | Vapor Perm | Best Application |\n|-----------------|--------|------------|------------------|\n| Fiberglass Batt | 3.2-3.8 | >10 | Walls, attics |\n| Mineral Wool Batt | 4.0 | >10 | Walls, fire-rated |\n| Cellulose (blown) | 3.7 | >10 | Attics, dense-pack walls |\n| Closed-Cell Spray | 6.5 | <1 | Foundations, roofing |\n| EPS | 4.0 | 2-5 | Exterior, below-grade |\n| XPS | 5.0 | 0.5-1.5 | Below-grade, roofing |\n| Polyiso | 6.0 | <1 (foil) | Exterior walls, roofing |"

      "content_md": "## BATT INSULATION INSTALLATION\n\n### Wall Cavity Installation\n\n**Materials:**\n- Insulation batts (proper width for cavity)\n- Utility knife with fresh blade\n- Straightedge or drywall square\n- Staple gun (if using faced batts)\n- PPE: Safety glasses, N95 mask, gloves, long sleeves\n\n**Step 1: Prepare the Cavity**\n- Verify air sealing is complete (all penetrations sealed)\n- Check for electrical boxes, wires, pipes\n- Ensure cavity is clean and dry\n- Confirm vapor barrier plan (faced batts or separate poly)\n\n**Step 2: Measure and Cut**\n- Measure cavity depth (should match batt thickness)\n- For obstructions, split batt and fit around (not compress)\n- Cut batts 1\" longer than cavity height for friction fit\n- Use straightedge for clean cuts\n\n**Step 3: Install Batts**\n\n**Proper installation technique:**\n1. Hold batt at top of cavity\n2. Tuck top edge behind top plate\n3. Unfurl batt down into cavity\n4. Batt should fill cavity without compression\n5. Friction fit—no gaps, no voids, no compression\n\n**Around electrical boxes:**\n- Split batt thickness in half\n- Place half behind box, half in front\n- Cut notch for box, maintain contact on all sides\n\n### Common Batt Installation Errors\n\n| Error | Problem | Correction |\n|-------|---------|------------|\n| Compressed batts | Reduced R-value (R-20 at 80% = R-16) | Use correct batt thickness for cavity |\n| Gaps and voids | Thermal bypass, condensation | Fill completely, no gaps |\n| Missing insulation behind boxes | Cold spots, condensation | Split and fit around |\n\n## BLOWN-IN INSULATION\n\n### Attic Installation (Cellulose or Fiberglass)\n\n**Step 1: Preparation**\n- Complete all air sealing first (critical!)\n- Install baffles at every rafter bay with soffit vents\n- Install dam boards at attic hatch\n- Mark target depth on trusses/rafters\n- Cover any can lights with IC-rated covers or dam boxes\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Coverage**\n\nCellulose coverage (bags per 1000 sq ft):\n\n| Target R-Value | Settled Thickness | Bags/1000 sq ft |\n|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| R-38 | 10.5\" | 22 |\n| R-49 | 13.5\" | 29 |\n| R-60 | 16.5\" | 35 |\n\n**Step 3: Blow Insulation**\n1. Start at far end of attic, work toward access\n2. Keep hose low, 1-2 feet above target depth\n3. Use slow, sweeping motion\n4. Build up to depth markers\n5. Fill completely around obstacles\n\n## RIGID INSULATION INSTALLATION\n\n### Exterior Wall Application\n\n**Step 1: Plan Layout**\n- Stagger joints from sheathing joints\n- Offset horizontal joints course to course\n- Plan cuts around windows and doors\n\n**Step 2: Install Boards**\n1. Start at corner or base\n2. Apply boards tight to sheathing\n3. Fasten with cap nails (4-6 per 4x8 sheet)\n4. Ensure edges align for taping\n\n**Step 3: Seal Joints**\n- Tape all seams with manufacturer-approved tape\n- Seal around windows and doors\n- Seal at top and bottom edges"
