      "content_md": "## Sealant Types & Selection\n\n### Why Sealants Matter\n\nExterior sealants are the first line of defense at joints and transitions. Failed sealants lead to:\n- Water infiltration\n- Air leakage (energy loss)\n- Rot and structural damage\n- Mold and indoor air quality issues\n\n### Sealant Categories\n\n| Type | Movement | Adhesion | Lifespan | Best Uses |\n|------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| **Silicone** | Excellent (50%+) | Fair | 20+ yrs | Glass, metal, non-porous |\n| **Polyurethane** | Very Good (25-50%) | Excellent | 15-20 yrs | Wood, concrete, most surfaces |\n| **Hybrid (STPE)** | Very Good (25-35%) | Excellent | 20+ yrs | All-purpose exterior |\n| **Latex/Acrylic** | Poor (5-10%) | Good | 5-10 yrs | Interior, paint-over needs |\n| **Butyl** | Good (15-25%) | Good | 10-15 yrs | Flashing, roofing, gutters |\n\n### Application-Specific Recommendations\n\n**Windows & Doors:**\n- Primary: Silicone or hybrid STPE\n- Paintable option: Polyurethane\n- Never use latex on exterior\n\n**Siding & Trim:**\n- Paintable polyurethane best\n- Hybrid STPE for color-matched\n- Allow proper cure before painting\n\n**Concrete & Masonry:**\n- Polyurethane or hybrid\n- Silicone for non-paintable applications\n- Self-leveling for horizontal joints\n\n**Roofing & Flashing:**\n- Butyl-based for metal\n- Roofing-specific products\n- UV-stable formulations\n\n> **Zone 6 Critical:** Choose sealants rated for -40°F to +200°F temperature range. Cold-weather application products available for winter repairs."

      "content_md": "## Joint Preparation\n\n### The 3-Step Process\n\nProper preparation determines sealant success:\n\n**1. Clean**\n- Remove old sealant completely\n- Scrape, cut, or use sealant remover\n- Wire brush loose material\n- Solvent wipe for oils/residue\n\n**2. Dry**\n- No moisture in joint\n- Use heat gun if needed\n- Wait after rain/dew\n- Test with tape adhesion\n\n**3. Prime (If Required)**\n- Some substrates need primer\n- Follow manufacturer specs\n- Allow proper flash time\n- Don't skip this step!\n\n### Substrate Preparation Guide\n\n| Substrate | Cleaning Method | Primer Needed? |\n|-----------|-----------------|----------------|\n| **Aluminum** | Solvent wipe | Usually no |\n| **Vinyl** | Soap/water, solvent | Usually no |\n| **Wood (painted)** | Scrape, sand, wipe | No |\n| **Wood (bare)** | Sand, dust off | Sometimes |\n| **Concrete** | Wire brush, solvent | Often yes |\n| **Brick** | Wire brush, blow clean | Often yes |\n| **Glass** | Glass cleaner, solvent | Usually no |\n\n### Backer Rod Installation\n\n**Purpose:**\n- Controls sealant depth\n- Creates proper shape factor\n- Prevents three-sided adhesion\n- Allows sealant movement\n\n**Selection:**\n- Open-cell: For wet applications\n- Closed-cell: Standard exterior\n- Size: 25-50% larger than joint width\n\n**Installation:**\n1. Measure joint depth\n2. Select backer rod size\n3. Push in with blunt tool\n4. Position 1/2 joint width from surface\n5. No gaps or stretching\n\n### Ideal Joint Dimensions\n\n**Width-to-Depth Ratio:**\n- Joints 1/4\" to 1/2\": 1:1 ratio (depth = width)\n- Joints over 1/2\": 2:1 ratio (depth = half width)\n- Never deeper than wide"

      "content_md": "## Application Techniques\n\n### Tools Required\n\n- Quality caulk gun (smooth rod preferred)\n- Utility knife for tip cutting\n- Tooling spatulas or fingers\n- Blue painter's tape\n- Rags and solvent for cleanup\n- Backer rod in various sizes\n\n### Cutting the Tip\n\n**Best Practice:**\n- Cut at 45° angle\n- Match opening to joint width\n- Start smaller, can always enlarge\n- Clean cut (no jagged edges)\n\n**Opening Size:**\n| Joint Width | Tip Opening |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| 1/4\" | 3/16\" |\n| 3/8\" | 1/4\" |\n| 1/2\" | 3/8\" |\n| 3/4\" | 1/2\" |\n\n### Application Method\n\n**Gun Technique:**\n1. Pierce inner seal with rod\n2. Hold gun at 45° to surface\n3. Push bead ahead of tip\n4. Maintain steady pressure\n5. Release trigger before stopping\n\n**Bead Profile:**\n- Slightly overfill joint\n- Consistent size throughout\n- No gaps or thin spots\n- Plan for tooling to spread\n\n### Tooling the Joint\n\n**Why Tool:**\n- Forces sealant into joint\n- Creates smooth finish\n- Ensures substrate contact\n- Proper concave shape\n\n**Tooling Method:**\n1. Tool within 5 minutes of application\n2. Use wet finger, spatula, or foam tool\n3. Firm pressure against both sides\n4. One continuous stroke\n5. Remove excess, don't add\n\n**Tooling Aids:**\n- Soapy water for silicone\n- Denatured alcohol for polyurethane\n- Nothing for STPE hybrids\n\n### Tape Masking\n\n**For Clean Lines:**\n1. Apply tape along both sides of joint\n2. Leave 1/16\" gap at joint edge\n3. Apply sealant over tape\n4. Tool immediately\n5. Remove tape immediately while wet\n6. Pull tape at 45° angle"

Check flashing integrity (repair if needed)\n3. Install backer rod if joint >1/4\"\n4. Apply compatible sealant\n5. Tool for smooth finish\n6. Seal head and jambs; leave sill weep gaps\n\n> **Important:** Don't seal bottom of window frames - weep holes allow drainage.\n\n### Siding Joint Repairs\n\n**Butt Joints (Fiber Cement):**\n1. Clean joint thoroughly\n2. Prime cut edges if exposed\n3. Apply paintable sealant\n4. Tool flush with surface\n5. Paint to match after cure\n\n**Corner Board Gaps:**\n1. Remove loose caulk\n2. Check for rot behind\n3. Fill large gaps with backer rod\n4. Apply flexible sealant\n5. Tool and paint\n\n### Masonry & Concrete Sealing\n\n**Control Joints:**\n1. Clean out debris and old sealant\n2. Insert closed-cell backer rod\n3. Apply self-leveling polyurethane\n4. Do not tool (self-levels)\n5. Allow full cure before traffic\n\n**Wall-to-Foundation:**\n1. Wire brush joint clean\n2. Apply masonry primer if needed\n3. Install backer rod\n4. Apply polyurethane sealant\n5. Tool for positive contact\n\n### Penetration Sealing\n\n**Pipes & Conduits:**\n1. Clean pipe and wall surface\n2. Apply sealant around perimeter\n3. Build up in layers if large gap\n4. Tool for continuous seal\n5. Consider boot for large pipes\n\n**Wires & Cables:**\n1. Group wires together if possible\n2. Apply sealant around bundle\n3. Ensure full coverage\n4. Verify interior seal also complete"
