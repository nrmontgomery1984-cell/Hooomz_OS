Proper exterior drainage:\n- Prevents hydrostatic pressure against foundation\n- Protects basement from water infiltration\n- Reduces frost heaving potential\n- Extends foundation lifespan\n- Prevents soil erosion\n\n### Surface Drainage Principles\n\n**Positive Slope Away from Building:**\n\n| Distance | Minimum Slope |\n|----------|---------------|\n| First 6 feet | 6\" drop (1\" per foot) |\n| Beyond 6 feet | 2% minimum (1/4\" per foot) |\n\n**NBC Requirement:**\n> Ground surface within 1.8m (6 feet) of foundation must slope away with minimum 5% grade (6 inches over 10 feet).\n\n### Grading Problems to Avoid\n\n| Problem | Consequence | Solution |\n|---------|-------------|----------|\n| Negative slope | Water flows to foundation | Re-grade with proper slope |\n| Settlement near foundation | Ponding at walls | Add soil, compact, slope away |\n| Flat areas | Standing water | Create swales or drains |\n| Soil against siding | Rot, insects | Maintain 8\" clearance |\n\n### Soil Types & Drainage\n\n| Soil Type | Drainage | Considerations |\n|-----------|----------|----------------|\n| **Sandy/Gravelly** | Excellent | May drain too fast |\n| **Loam** | Good | Ideal for most situations |\n| **Silty** | Fair | Can become impermeable when wet |\n| **Clay** | Poor | Holds water, requires special attention |\n\n> **NB Reality:** Many areas have clay soils or hardpan that don't drain well. Assume worst-case and design accordingly."

Excavate Trench**\n- Along footer, never ON footer\n- 12\" below top of footer minimum\n- Wide enough for pipe and stone\n\n**2. Line with Filter Fabric**\n- Extend up sides\n- Leave excess to wrap over top\n- No gaps or tears\n\n**3. Place Stone Bed**\n- 4\" of 3/4\" clear stone\n- Level along trench\n- Maintain slope to outlet\n\n**4. Install Pipe**\n- Holes DOWN (common mistake: holes up)\n- Maintain 1/8\" per foot slope\n- Connect sections firmly\n\n**5. Cover with Stone**\n- Minimum 4\" over pipe\n- Completely surround pipe\n- Maintain filter fabric position\n\n**6. Wrap with Fabric**\n- Fold fabric over stone\n- Overlap minimum 6\"\n- Secure with staples if needed\n\n### Outlet Options\n\n| Type | Description | Best For |\n|------|-------------|----------|\n| **Daylight** | Pipe exits on slope | Sloped lots |\n| **Sump Pump** | Collects in pit, pumps out | Flat lots, no gravity outlet |\n| **Dry Well** | Disperses into ground | Well-drained soils |\n| **Storm Sewer** | Connects to municipal system | Urban areas (if permitted) |"

Mark swale route\n2. Excavate to grade\n3. Compact subgrade\n4. Add 2-4\" topsoil\n5. Seed or sod\n6. Install erosion control until established\n\n### French Drains\n\nSubsurface drains for areas with poor drainage.\n\n**Installation:**\n1. Dig trench 12-18\" deep\n2. Line with filter fabric\n3. Add 4\" gravel base\n4. Install perforated pipe (4\" minimum)\n5. Cover with gravel to within 4\" of surface\n6. Wrap fabric over gravel\n7. Top with soil and turf\n\n### Catch Basins\n\n**Components:**\n- Grated inlet\n- Basin (collection box)\n- Outlet pipe to discharge\n\n**Installation:**\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| 1 | Excavate for basin + gravel bed |\n| 2 | Set basin on compacted gravel |\n| 3 | Level and align |\n| 4 | Connect outlet pipe |\n| 5 | Backfill and grade toward inlet |\n| 6 | Install grate |\n\n### Pop-Up Emitters\n\n**Purpose:** Discharge buried pipe at grade level\n\n**Installation:**\n- At end of underground drain runs\n- Opens when water pressure builds\n- Closes when pressure drops\n- Prevents debris entry\n- Place on slope, away from building\n\n### Dry Wells\n\n**For dispersing water into soil:**\n\n1. Excavate pit (4' x 4' x 4' typical)\n2. Line with filter fabric\n3. Fill with large stone or dry well chamber\n4. Connect inlet pipe\n5. Cover with fabric and soil\n6.

Backfill in Lifts**\n- 8-12\" lifts maximum\n- Compact each lift\n- Don't dump large volumes at once\n- Protect membrane from damage\n\n**3.

Ponding Near Foundation**\n\n| Cause | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| Settlement | Add soil, compact, re-grade |\n| Hardpan layer | Break through, add drain |\n| Blocked drain | Clean or replace drainage |\n| Improper grade | Re-grade to positive slope |\n\n**2. Wet Basement Walls**\n\n| Location | Likely Cause | Solution |\n|----------|--------------|----------|\n| Base of wall | Footer drain failure | Clean/repair drain system |\n| Mid-wall | Surface water entry | Improve grading |\n| Top of wall | Splash/surface water | Extend downspouts, grade |\n| Everywhere | High water table | May need sump system |\n\n**3. Footer Drain Failure**\n\n**Signs:**\n- Water in basement\n- Sump runs constantly\n- Hydrostatic pressure cracks\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Camera inspection of pipes\n- Jetting to clear blockages\n- Interior drain system as alternative\n- Excavation and replacement (last resort)\n\n### Inspection Access\n\n**Install cleanouts:**\n- At corners of foundation\n- Every 100' maximum\n- At changes in direction\n- Accessible from grade\n\n> **Pro Tip:** Install cleanouts during initial construction - much cheaper than adding later when problems arise.\n\n### When to Call a Professional\n\n- Persistent basement water despite corrections\n- Foundation cracking from hydrostatic pressure\n- Major grading changes needed\n- Sump pump runs continuously\n- Signs of structural movement"
