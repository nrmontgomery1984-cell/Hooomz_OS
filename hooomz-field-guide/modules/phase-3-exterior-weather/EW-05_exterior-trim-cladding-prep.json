      "content_md": "## Cladding System Overview\n\n### Purpose of Cladding\n\nCladding serves multiple functions in the building envelope:\n\n1. **Weather Protection:** Primary defense against rain, snow, wind\n2. **Aesthetic Appeal:** Visual appearance of the building\n3. **UV Protection:** Shields WRB and structure from sun damage\n4. **Impact Resistance:** Protects from physical damage\n\n### Common Cladding Types in NB\n\n| Type | Durability | Maintenance | Cost | Suitability |\n|------|------------|-------------|------|-------------|\n| **Vinyl Siding** | 25-40 yrs | Low | $ | Excellent - expands/contracts well |\n| **Fiber Cement** | 50+ yrs | Medium | $$ | Excellent - handles freeze/thaw |\n| **Wood Siding** | 20-40 yrs | High | $$-$$$ | Good if maintained |\n| **Engineered Wood** | 25-30 yrs | Medium | $$ | Good - verify warranty |\n| **Metal Siding** | 40+ yrs | Low | $$-$$$ | Excellent - no rot |\n| **Brick Veneer** | 100+ yrs | Low | $$$$ | Excellent - thermal mass |\n| **Stone Veneer** | 50+ yrs | Low | $$$ | Good - weight considerations |\n\n### Rainscreen Principle\n\n> **Best Practice:** In Zone 6, rainscreen assemblies significantly reduce moisture problems and extend cladding life.\n\n**How Rainscreens Work:**\n1. Gap between cladding and WRB\n2. Allows drainage of any water that penetrates\n3. Provides drying through ventilation\n4. Reduces pressure differentials\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Extends WRB and cladding life\n- Reduces rot and mold risk\n- Improves drying potential\n- Better performance in driving rain"

Plan Layout**\n- Vertical furring for horizontal siding\n- Horizontal furring for vertical siding\n- Consider window/door integration\n\n**2. Locate Studs**\n- Mark stud locations on WRB\n- Furring must hit framing for secure attachment\n- Use stud finder or measure from corners\n\n**3. Install Furring**\n\n| Fastener | Min Length | Spacing |\n|----------|------------|--------|\n| Screws (recommended) | Penetrate stud 1-1/2\" | Every 12\" |\n| Nails | Penetrate stud 1-1/2\" | Every 8\" |\n\n**4. Check for Plane**\n- Use straightedge across furring\n- Shim as needed for flat plane\n- Critical for proper siding installation\n\n### Ventilation Pathways\n\n**Inlets and Outlets:**\n- Bottom: Vented starter strip or perforated metal\n- Top: Vented soffit or top outlet\n- Maintain continuous airflow path\n\n**Insect Protection:**\n- Use 1/8\" mesh at all openings\n- Stainless steel or copper mesh preferred\n- Prevents wasp/bee entry\n\n### Cross-Furring for Continuous Insulation\n\n**Over Rigid Foam:**\n1. Install foam board with taped seams\n2. Vertical furring over foam into studs\n3. Fastener length = foam + furring + 1-1/2\"\n\n> **Example:** 2\" foam + 3/4\" furring + 1-1/2\" penetration = 4-1/4\" screws minimum"
